west ham or sheffield united ties to be played on february wright phillips to start on right england coach sven goran eriksson has revealed shaun wright phillips will start against the netherlands but wright phillips will not make his first start for england playing on the left as had been widely expected shaun wright phillips will probably start the game said eriksson but not going to start wright phillips on the left eriksson also revealed that wes brown will start alongside jamie carragher in the injury hit centre of defence when asked if brown and carragher would start eriksson replied could tell you yes it blow that four or five central defenders are away because of injuries on the other hand it good for carragher and brown to show what they can do at this level that positive the england coach said that he had been impressed by wright phillips form for manchester city he deserves his chance he has been playing well all season and look forward to seeing him and he added that andy johnson and stewart downing the other two new players in the squad would also get chance to impress wright phillips downing and johnson will start or get the chance to play some part johnson was not in my plans year ago but he is doing great season and scoring lot of goals downing is another one making great season he is young talented and there are not too many left footed players in the squad barkley fit for match in ireland england centre olly barkley has been passed fit for sunday six nations clash with ireland at lansdowne road barkley withdrew from bath team for friday clash with gloucester after suffering calf injury in training gloucester centre henry paul has also been cleared to play after overcoming an ankle injury england coach andy robinson who names his team on wednesday has called up bath prop duncan bell following phil vickery broken arm with vickery sidelined for at least six weeks and julian white out with neck injury bell could make his england debut bell had set his sights on an international career with wales but last december the international rugby board confirmed that he could only be eligible for england as he had travelled on tour with them in thought burned all my bridges with england when expressed an interest in wanting to play for wales so it fantastic to get this opportunity he said bell who featured in the england side which beat france days ago added recognise that got into the england squad because of injuries and it the same again in getting into the senior squad but now that have this opportunity intend to take it fully if selected and play my heart out for my country england coach andy robinson could take gamble and call inexperienced sale sharks prop andrew sheridan into his front row but sheridan favours the loosehead side of the scrum and more likely scenario is for uncapped bell who was among the try scorers when england beat france nine days ago to be drafted in navratilova hits out at critics martina navratilova has defended her decision to prolong her tennis career at the age of navratilova who made comeback after retiring in will play doubles and mixed doubles events in women tennis is really strong she said dismissing suggestions that the fact she could still win reflected badly on the women game all can say is that damn good sorry but really have to blow my own horn here still that good navratilova has won three grand slam mixed doubles titles since she came out of retirement and she was so encouraged by her form that she decided to resume playing singles winning two of her seven matches she was knocked out in the first round of the french open but reached the second round at wimbledon navratilova will partner nathalie dechy in the doubles event at the uncle toby hardcourts tournament on australia gold coast which begins on sunday she will then link up with daniela hantuchova for the australian open doubles and play in the mixed doubles with leander paes might be playing some singles events this season depending on the surface she added can smith work scottish wonders the worst kept secret in scottish football was revealed on thursday when walter smith was named as the new national manager from the moment berti vogts miserable tenure in charge of scotland ended the former rangers and everton boss has been the overwhelming favourite for the post but is smith the man for what must be one of the hardest jobs in football the year old takes over at time when the national side is in the doldrums scotland have not reached major finals since the world cup in and reaching germany looks near impossible having picked up just two points from the opening three games in the qualifying race and the fifa rankings see scotland listed at an all time low of th below the likes of estonia ghana angola and thailand scotland are not blessed with quality players with experience at the top level so smith will have to get the best out of meagre resources smith track record make impressive reading and he is widely respected within the game the man who was alex ferguson assistant when scotland played at the world cup won seven league titles with rangers and his appointment has been widely endorsed by many of the games top names including ferguson and graeme souness who took him to ibrox as his assistant in characters like souness ferguson and current ibrox manager alex mcleish all cite smith experience and his expansive knowledge of the scottish game much was made of vogts inability to express himself to the players and media that will certainly not be the case with smith the former dundee united and dumbarton full back is from the managerial old school straight talking and never slow to let players know when he expects better often with the use of some colourful invective but it should be remembered vogts came to scotland with an impressive curriculum vitae world cup winner as player and european championships winner as manager smith will inherit the same problems vogts had callow squad of players with no exceptional talents and it remains to be seen if smith will experience the rash of call offs that blighted so much of vogts preparation work fresh start for the scottish national team was imperative and smith is widely regarded as safe pair of hands but will safe pair of hands be enough when the adroit hands of magician might be required european medal chances improve what have the european indoor trials told us well think we could be heading to the european championships with half dozen medal prospects it was good to see athletes beginning to make steps forward to see few new faces and there were lots of personal bests kicking around the best performance on the track for me was sarah claxton win in the hurdles running sub eight seconds twice in week puts her right up there and if she repeats that in madrid she will be close to picking up medal but what was great about sunday performance was that she was under pressure to produce the goods when it counted diane allahgreen has been our best hurdler for some time now and think she was surprised to be beaten by sarah and knowing that she got the better of diane in head to head race will give sarah confidence in the men race on saturday allan scott was right in there and there is definitely more to come from him in fact the men hurdles is so strong think the selectors will pick three hurdlers to go to madrid phillips idowu lit up the field events not only with his hair but also with his leap of which puts him at the top of the world rankings had chat with him before the competition and he was really looking forward to getting out there he feels he is in great shape and has some big jumps inside him but then phillips always has lot of the athletes said the runway was not very helpful so for phillips to jump like that is good performance he is such huge talent but just needs some consistency and if he does that then the big jumps will get even further across the board thought kelly sotherton had great weekend and continued to show she is developing she picked up three personal bests in the long jump high jump and hurdles and you can ask for more than that kelly will be up against carolina kluft in the pentathlon at the european championships but she has every chance of medal on the basis of what we ve seen so far she has complicated training regime where different people help her with different disciplines but it seems to be working really well it wasn all good news in sheffield thought both the races were disappointing in different ways jason gardener may have won but he wasn at his best chatted to him afterwards and he knows it was an off day for him he there to be shot at and the other lads nearly got big scalp out there in the women race jeanette kwayke was hoping to run against defending champion joice maduaka the pair are enjoying bit of rivalry but joice had to pull out with chest infection if she had made the final think jeanette would have gone bit quicker janine whitlock competed well in the pole vault on her return following two year drugs ban but the most disappointing thing in the wider view is that she is our best pole vaulter by long way and that shouldn be the case the event has moved on immensely since janine has been away and if there was more domestic competition think that would help her couple of other interesting topics to look out for are the citizenship issues surrounding mark findlay and rabah yusuf findlay is londoner who has chosen to represent trinidad and tobago but has never run for them so he could still compete for great britain yusuf who came third in the is from the sudan but is trying to gain british citizenship he came to britain as high jumper but damaged his toe started doing more running and found his talent so we shall have to see what happens to both of them dundee utd aberdeen dundee united eased into the semi final of the scottish cup with an emphatic win over aberdeen alan archibald prodded united ahead in minutes and james grady made it two from close range minutes later richie byrne header gave aberdeen way back into the game but stevie crawford restored united lead from yards before half time the scoring was completed by grady just after the break superb shot on the turn making it tony bullock in the united goal was called into action for the first time with just over quarter of an hour on the clock noel whelan laid the ball off to jamie winter on the edge of the box but his first time effort was gathered by the united keeper moments later though the home side took the lead barry robson whipped in free kick from the right which stevie crawford caught on the volley russell anderson failed to deal with it and whelan clearance off the line landed kindly at the feet of archibald who poked the ball into the net united doubled their lead after minutes when grady tapped the ball into an empty net after robson had headed mark wilson cross off the angle of post and bar but only three minutes later aberdeen clawed their way back into the match free kick from the left by winter was met powerfully by the head of byrne at the back post leaving bullock helpless united restored their two goal lead four minutes before the end of highly entertaining first half jason scotland played perfectly weighted pass into the path of the onrushing crawford and he coolly beat ryan esson from yards united ended the game as contest just two minutes after the interval grady received pass from crawford with his back to goal on the edge of the box and after taking one touch he spun to volley the ball past the despairing dive of esson the home side were in complete control and it required good stop from esson to keep out robson drive after minutes the keeper denied the same player again minutes later beating away his fierce shot from the left of the penalty area robson saw another long range effort tipped round the post before cute lob was headed off the line bullock duff wilson ritchie archibald scotland samuel brebner kerr cameron robson crawford grady colgan dodds kenneth brebner archibald grady crawford grady esson hart anderson diamond byrne morrison mcnaughton heikkinen foster winter clark stewart mackie whelan blanchard mcguire anderson diamond byrne clark kenteris denies faking road crash greek sprinter kostas kenteris has denied claims that he faked motorbike crash to avoid doping test days before the start of the olympics kenteris and fellow sprinter katerina thanou are set to learn if they will face criminal charges this week part of the investigation has centred on whether they staged the crash kenteris insisted the accident happened went crazy when found out had supposedly missed test and wanted to rush to the olympic village kenteris speaking on greece alter television station also claimed that he asked to be tested for banned substances in hospital after the crash told the hospital which was an olympics accredited hospital to call the ioc and have me tested on the spot but no one came after drama which dominated newspaper headlines in greece as athens prepared for the start of the athens games kenteris and thanou eventually withdrew but kenteris has continually protested his innocence and on sunday blamed greek olympic committee officials and his former coach christos tzekos for failing to inform him of the test the year old insisted he will be happy if he is charged so he can clear his name if decision is taken to have charges filed against me will accept it gladly prosecution means that the case will be cleared want to go to the end and then we ll see who right and who isn kenteris greek hero after winning gold in the at the olympics in sydney also confirmed that he was due to light the flame at the athens opening ceremony had even rehearsed lighting the cauldron he said bath faced with tindall ultimatum mike tindall agent has warned bath they have until next week to improve their contract offer to the england man or risk losing him to rival club dipo alli says he has received an offer for tindall which dwarfs bath deal and that two other clubs want to talk mike does not want to go into the six nations worrying about where he will be playing his club rugby next season alli told the guardian newspaper it is up to bath owner andrew brownsword he has to make it happen tindall is out of contract at the end of the season but it is understood that brownsword is unwilling to break the club salary structure to accommodate the year old demands but alli insists the player is worth more than bath have put on the table mike has been at bath for eight years and wants to remain with the club and his demands are anything but excessive the agent added but brownsword has to recognise mike value and we want to resolve things by the end of next week barcelona title hopes hit by loss barcelona pursuit of the spanish title took blow on sunday as they fell to defeat at home to atletico madrid fernando torres gave athletico an ideal start with goal in the first minute ronaldino wasted second half chance to equalise for barca when he put penalty wide but torres made no such mistake with last minute spot kick the defeat coupled with real madrid win over espanyol on saturday reduces barca lead to four points former everton midfielder thomas gravesen scored his first goal for real in the comfortable victory at the bernabeu zinedine zidane had opened the scoring before raul bagged brace gravesen who replaced zidane completed the scoring in the th minute with low shot david beckham watched by sven goran eriksson came off in the th minute with shoulder injury but should be fit for england game against holland england team mate michael owen came on for raul after minutes with the game already won real have now won six consecutive primera liga games since coach wanderley luxemburgo took charge healey targets england comeback leicester wing austin healey hopes to use sunday return heineken cup clash with wasps as further springboard to an england recall for the six nations healey who won caps prior to the world cup has been in good form in the tigers resurgence this season definitely still have ambitions to play for england healey told the bbc we will have to see what happens after the previous autumn tests but when look at the current squad definitely feel there is place there for me healey who has also played both half back positions and full back during his career has reverted to the wing where he won most of his england caps after recovering from trapped nerve in his back sustained at the end of september the year old is relishing his role in the tigers revival had six weeks out but fortunately have resumed the sort of form had before he said am basically playing where it best suits leicester obviously can play scrum half fly half or full back at moment notice but playing on the wing actually gives me bigger free role to come in where am not expected and influence things that has been apparent in parts one and two of the wasps leicester trilogy in recent weeks first healey came off his flank with an angled run to score an injury time try that earned the tigers draw in their premiership meeting on november then in the first of their heineken cup double header last sunday healey slotted in at stand off and delivered superb cross kick for martin corry to score the tigers third try caught cozza eye couple of phases before that and was hoping to get it to him on the full but fortunately even with the bounce he managed to score healey recalled healey twice heineken cup winner believes last sunday match was up there with some of the biggest club contests he has played in it was very intense occasion and very destructive game he recalled there was not huge amount of rugby played but it was great game to be involved in after about minutes thought we might stride away with it but wasps really came back into it and in the last couple of minutes it could have gone either way the same outcome this sunday would put leicester in pole position to top their heineken pool with home game against biarritz and away trip to calvisano to come but healey insists the tigers must summon the same desire if they are to deliver the knockout blow in what has been dubbed rugby version of rocky ii there was lot of satisfaction in the dressing room aftewards but it is really only case of job half done he added it was the first of two leg trip and if we lose at welford road it will negate all the positives we can take from result think it came down to who wanted it more and in the end think we did we have got to show the same desire again this week van nistelrooy set to return manchester united striker ruud van nistelrooy may make his comeback after an achilles tendon injury in the fa cup fifth round tie at everton on saturday he has been out of action for nearly three months and had targeted return in the champions league tie with ac milan on february but manchester united manager sir alex ferguson hinted he may be back early he said there is chance he could be involved at everton but we ll just have to see how he comes through training the year old has been training in holland and ferguson said ruud comes back on tuesday and we need to assess how far on he is the training he has been doing in holland has been perfect and am very satisfied with it even without van nistelrooy united made it wins in league games with derby victory at manchester city on sunday but they will be boosted by the return of the dutch international who is the club top scorer this season with goals he has not played since aggravating the injury in the win against west brom on november ferguson was unhappy with van nistelrooy for not revealing he was carrying an injury united have also been hit by injuries to both alan smith and louis saha during van nistelrooy absence meaning wayne rooney has sometimes had to play in lone role up front the teenager has responded with six goals in nine games including the first goal against city on sunday dibaba breaks world record ethiopia tirunesh dibaba set new world record in winning the women at the boston indoor games dibaba won in minutes seconds to erase the previous world indoor mark of set by another ethiopian berhane adera in stuttgart last year but compatriot kenenisa bekele record hopes were dashed when he miscounted his laps in the men and staged his sprint finish lap too soon ireland alistair cragg won in as bekele battled to second in didn want to sit back and get out kicked said cragg so kept on the pace the plan was to go with to go no matter what but when bekele made the mistake that was it the race was mine sweden carolina kluft the olympic heptathlon champion and slovenia jolanda ceplak had winning performances too kluft took the long jump at while ceplak easily won the women in mcilroy wins indoor title james mcilroy motored to the aaa indoor title in sheffied on sunday in time of one minute seconds the larne athlete dominated the race from start to finish although he had to hold off late challenge from welshman jimmy watkins in the final metres had to go out and go through all the gears before the europeans and won run again until then said mcilroy though if got lucky get close to the british record but blew up in the end mcilroy has been in superb form at the start of the season and will now start his build up for the european indoors at madrid on march meanwhile paul brizzel and anna boyle reached the semi finals of the hurdles with boyle setting season best of in the women final ailis mcsweeney broke michelle carroll long standing irish record by clocking which left her in third place david gillick showed that he is genuine medal contender in the european indoor championships by claiming an impressive victory gillick was more than half second clear when taking gold in outside his personal best set in saturday semi finals the irishman is now the fastest european this season derval rourke broke her own irish hurdles record by clocking which left her third behind new british record holder sarah claxton james nolan took second in the men behind neil speaight but the offaly man was outside the european indoor standard colin costello was seventh in

murray was th in the men meanwhile stephen cairns and jill shannon claimed the individual titles at saturday northern ireland cross country championship in coleraine cairns came in ahead of paul rowan

ferguson was left ruing manchester united failure to close the gap on chelsea everton and arsenal after his side draw with fulham premiership leaders chelsea and the gunners endured stalemate on sunday giving united the chance to make up some ground in the league but ferguson said think what makes it so bad is that both our rivals dropped points at the weekend it was great opportunity and we haven delivered united went ahead through alan smith in the rd minute before bouba diop superb yard strike cancelled out the visitors lead in the th minute ferguson described the result as an absolute giveaway after united had earlier missed host of opportunities to finish off the encounter he said it was good performance some of the football was fantastic but we just didn finish them off in fairness it fantastic strike from the fulham player the result leaves ferguson side fourth in the league on points four points behind arsenal and further five back from chelsea robinson out of six nations england captain jason robinson will miss the rest of the six nations because of injury robinson stand in captain in the absence of jonny wilkinson had been due to lead england in their final two games against italy and scotland but the sale full back pulled out of the squad on wednesday because of torn ligament in his right thumb the year old will undergo an operation on friday but england have yet to name replacement skipper robinson said this is very disappointing for me as this means miss england last two games in the six nations at twickenham and two games for my club sale sharks but looking to be back playing very early in april robinson picked up the injury in the defeat to ireland at lansdowne road on saturday and coach andy robinson said am hugely disappointed for jason as england captain he has been an immense figure during the autumn internationals and the six nations leading by example at all times look forward to having him back in the england squad the announcement is the latest setback for robinson injury depleted squad among the key figures already missing are jonny wilkinson mike tindall will greenwood julian white and phil vickery list which leaves robinson short on candidates for the now vacant captaincy role former england skipper jeremy guscott told bbc radio five live his choice would be matt dawson even though he is does not hold regular starting place the obvious choice is dawson said guscott especially given that harry ellis did not have his best game at scrum half on saturday dawson has the credentials and the experience even though his winning record at captain is not great the other option in martin corry who is the standout forward at the moment unfortunately england cannot rely on leaders on the field at the moment england will announce their squad for the march game against italy on saturday moya emotional at davis cup win carlos moya described spain davis cup victory as the highlight of his career after he beat andy roddick to end the usa challenge in seville moya made up for missing spain victory through injury by beating roddick to give the hosts an unassailable lead have woken up so many nights dreaming of this day said moya all my energy has been focused on today what have lived today do not think will live again spain only other davis cup title came two years ago in valencia when they beat australia and moya nicknamed charly admitted the davis cup is my dream and was bit nervous at the outset some people have said that am obsessed but think that it is better this way it helps me reach my goals if am obsessed it really incredible to get the winning point is really something spanish captain jordi arrese said charly played great game it was his opportunity and he hasn let us down he had lost three times to roddick and this was his day to beat him he had been waiting years to be in this position spain victory was also remarkable for the performance of rafael nadal who beat roddick in the opening singles aged years and days the mallorcan became the youngest player to win the davis cup what great way to finish the year said nadal afterwards us coach patrick mcenroe wants roddick and the rest of his team to play more tennis on clay and hone their skills on the surface think it will help these guys even on slow hard courts to learn how to mix things up little bit and to play little bit smarter and tactically better obviously it unrealistic to say that we re going to just start playing constantly on clay with the schedule but certainly think we can put the work in at the appropriate time and play couple more events and play against these guys who are the best on this stuff said mcenroe roddick was left frustrated after losing both his singles on the slow clay of seville olympic stadium it just tough because felt like was in it the whole time against one of the top three clay courters in the world said the american had my chances and just didn convert them the bottom line is they were just better than us this weekend they came out took care of business and they beat us it as simple as that charvis set to lose fitness bid flanker colin charvis is unlikely to play any part in wales final two games of the six nations charvis has missed all three of wales victories with an ankle injury and his recovery has been slower than expected he will not figure in the scotland game and is now thought unlikely to be ready for the final game said wales physio mark davies sonny parker is continuing to struggle with neck injury but hal luscombe should be fit for the murrayfield trip centre parker has only slim chance of being involved against the scots on march so luscombe return to fitness after missing the france match with hamstring trouble is timely boost said wales assistant coach scott johnson we re positive about hal and hope he ll be raring to go he comes back into the mix again adds to the depth and gives us other options replacement hooker robin mcbryde remains doubt after picking up knee ligament damage in paris last saturday we re getting that reviewed and we should know more by the end of the week how robin looking added johnson we re hopeful but it too early to say at this stage steve jones from the dragons is likely to be drafted in if mcbryde fails to recover cole refuses to blame van persie ashley cole has refused to blame robin van persie for leaving arsenal with no fully fit strikers for the fa cup fifth round replay at sheffield united van persie is suspended alongside dennis bergkamp and jose antonio reyes after being sent off at southampton when arsenal had numerical advantage thierry henry is ruled out with an achilles tendon injury but cole said no one is putting the blame on robin it just something that happens on the spur of the moment cole added ve done it before and hope they didn blame me for anything of course he ll learn ve been sent off couple of times now and it just one of those things when you go bit crazy for one or two seconds freddie ljungberg is likely to be used in an emergency striking role and will be partnered by either arturo lupoli quincy owusu abeyie or jeremie aliadiere gunners boss arsene wenger said freddie is an option but we need second striker have to decide whether it will be aliadiere quincy or lupoli who will start with him up front those three will be involved arsenal are also without winger robert pires who sustained an ankle injury at st mary wenger added it doesn look like anything is fractured but it is good ankle sprain it does not look like pires will be ready for two to three weeks federer breezes into semi finals roger federer reached the last four of the qatar open with an easy win over seventh seed feliciano lopez the swiss world number one reeled off series winners to outclass the spaniard and set up semi final match against russian nikolay davydenko federer who lost in the quarter final in his last qatar appearance in was happy with his form think played better than against greg rusedski and am happy am playing so well said the top seed lopez showed glimpses of resolve early in the second set when he held his first service game and came close to breaking federer but the swiss saved break point and promptly broke serve in the following game to seize control davydenko meanwhile upset french third seed sebastien

one year suspension kenteris and thanou already face criminal trial after being charged with avoiding drug test on the eve of the athens olympics and then faking motorcyle crash no date for the trial

they never lost the hosts cut the gap to with minutes left and nearly scored through ludovico nitoglia but denis hickie try ensured an irish victory italy came flying out of the blocks and took the lead through luciano orquera penalty after seven minutes it could have been better for the hosts but the fly half missed two kickable penalties and ireland drew level with ronan gara penalty midway through the first half the italians were driving at the heart of the irish defence and for the first quarter the irish pack struggled to secure any ball for their talented backs when they finally did just before the half hour mark driscoll promptly created sparkling try for murphy the ireland captain ran dummy scissors and made magical outside break before drawing the full back and putting the diving murphy in at the corner gara missed the twice taken conversion and the visitors found themselves trailing once again roland de marigny took over the kicking duties for italy from the hapless orquera and he landed penalty either side of the break to edge italy into lead the only ireland player offering real threat was driscoll and it was his break that set up the second try for the visitors shane horgan threw an overhead pass as he was about to be forced into touch and stringer scooted over with gara landing the tricky conversion penalty apiece saw ireland leading as the game entered the final quarter but they were lucky to survive when italy launched series of attacks winger nitoglia dropped the ball as he reached for the line and italy nearly rumbled over from driving maul an gara penalty put ireland more than converted try ahead and they made the game safe when hickie latched onto an inside pass from murphy and crossed for converted try driscoll limped off late on joining centre partner gordon arcy on the sidelines and the final word went to italy prop martin castrogiovanni powered over for try which was fitting reward for an italian pack which had kept the

clyde celtic celtic brushed aside clyde to secure their place in the scottish cup semi final but only after nervy and testing first half the home side craig bryson had goal chopped off before stan varga headed celtic into the lead alan thompson scored from the penalty spot at the start of the second half after shaun maloney had been fouled stilian petrov slid in third varga tapped in his second and craig bellamy completed the rout with fine drive bryn halliwell was the busier keeper early on saving from bellamy chris sutton and juninho clyde had the ball in the net after half an hour through tremendous strike from bryson but the referee had already blown for foul by petrov from the resulting free kick darren sheridan curled the ball round the celtic wall only for the post to deny him back at the other end halliwell did well to come off his line and block bellamy effort to lift the ball over him the keeper misjudged corner that stephane henchoz headed wide but similar scenario five minutes before the break led to the opening goal the ball was delivered from the left and halliwell was left floundering as varga glanced the ball into the net maloney replaced the injured sutton at half time and he marked his first competitive appearance after year out injured by helping his side take two goal lead just after the break the young striker fired free kick straight into the clyde wall but as he collected the rebound he was tripped by bryson and thompson converted the penalty sheridan and bellamy were involved in something of flare up that led to both being booked after the intervention of the assistant referee juninho brought out another good save from halliwell and then petrov saw tremendous effort come off the top of the bar but petrov and juninho combined brilliantly to allow the bulgarian to make it on the hour mark quick one two giving him the time and space to steer the ball past halliwell from yards varga got his second goal of the game as celtic drove home their advantage thompson whipped in corner from the right and the unmarked defender simply tapped the ball over the line from couple of yards out celtic were utterly dominant by this stage and bellamy opened his scoring account for the club after fine move involving aiden mcgeady jackie mcnamara and maloney culminated in the welshman hammering the ball into the net halliwell kept the deficit at

funding cut hits wales students the wales students rugby side has become casualty of the welsh rugby union reorganisation at youth level an amalgamated under side formed from separate schools and national youth teams plays its first match on thursday against italy at the gnoll but that move has seen the wru decide to end its funding of representative sides such as wales students as result traditional international fixtures against england and france in the new year have been cancelled the welsh students rugby football union feels that it is unable to properly prepare for or stage the matches the secretary of the welsh students rugby football union reverend eldon phillips said it is shame that fixtures cannot be maintained this year the competition provided by the strong english and french teams has enabled the welsh students to test themselves in high quality matches the increasing number of young rugby players entering higher education look for the biggest challenge that is representative rugby but this year that opportunity will be denied them players who have played for wales students before going on to win full senior representative honours include robert jones rob

former portsmouth boss replaces steve wigley who has been relieved of first team duties after just one win in league games in charge redknapp quit his fratton park position on november and vowed will not go down the road no chance pompey coach kevin bond is poised to join redknapp who will be saints third boss of the season redknapp first game in charge will be at home to middlesbrough on saturday portsmouth chairman milan mandaric said he was disappointed by the news and claimed redknapp had been in talks with southampton for some time it would appear that negotiations over this have been

mandaric redknapp vowed he would not join their south coast rivals when he left portsmouth said to harry hope you don go to southampton and he told me absolutely not he said wouldn say bitter disgusted or angry just disappointed but it harry life and it his decision redknapp became cult hero after leading portsmouth into the premiership for the first time and then masterminding their survival in their debut season but he left the club claiming he needed break from football though many believed he was upset with mandaric decision to bring in velimir zajec as executive director southampton chairman rupert lowe was desperate to give former academy director wigley who replaced paul sturrock just two games into the season every chance to succeed at st mary but results under

but wayne rooney put the tie beyond doubt late on with cool finish exeter had chances of their own sean devine twice volleying wide and andrew taylor forcing tim howard to save united boss sir alex ferguson was taking few chances after their draw in the first game and he handed starts to paul scholes and ryan as well as ronaldo and rooney exeter began brightly with devine and steve flack seeing plenty of the ball but it did not take united long to assert their authority and the hosts soon found themselves goal down scholes played lovely pass in to ronaldo on the left hand side of the six yard box and the portuguese winger slid the ball between the legs of jones to open the scoring united sensed chance to finish the tie as contest early on and ronaldo blazed over before jones saved well from scholes and then rooney the visitors pressure by now was incessant and rooney had another shot blocked while ronaldo slammed well over the bar again from good position just before the break giggs had golden chance to double the advantage but the welshman dragged left foot effort badly wide from yards in stoppage time exeter created their best chance as alex jeannin swung in cross from

investigations into allegations chelsea officials tapped up arsenal defender ashley cole in january what now for british tennis tim henman decision to quit davis cup tennis has left the british team with gargantuan void to fill the world number seven is tied for fourth among his countrymen for wins in the history of the tournament he has from his rubbers and great britain last davis cup win without henman came against slovenia as far back as worse could follow according to former british team member chris bailey bailey told bbc sport after tim announcement doubt greg rusedski will be that far behind him but without their top two where does that leave british ambitions in the sport premier team event captain jeremy bates has singled out alex bogdanovic and andrew murray as potential replacements the yugoslavian born bogdanovic though is places below henman in the world rankings and has played just two cup ties winning one and losing the other murray on the other hand is th in the current atp entry list and yet to make his cup debut but bailey does see some hope for the future he said now we ve dropped down to the euro africa zone the time was right for him to step down and let the young guys come to the fore britain next opponents israel are hardly likely to be quaking in their boots ahead of the march match against likely trio of bogdanovic murray and the th ranked arvind parmar bailey said it will be tough for gb to move up but there comes time when our young players have to step up this was always going to be inevitable with tim and greg growing years confident about the future wouldn lay money on us getting back into the world group next year but imagine in five years time we ll be competing for the major honours of those lining up to replace henman the year old murray with four futures titles under his belt last year looks the best long term bet murray is the one that looks likeliest to take over tim mantle said bailey he has an enormous amount of self confidence judging by what he said in the past bogdanovic three years murray senior has had more troubled time under britain davis cup umbrella while murray has been marked out as britain golden boy bogdanovic was warned by the lawn tennis association for lack of drive at the end of and bailey said despite that alex is clearly talented as well while arvind is another contender they re among the guys who have experienced the intensity of davis cup tennis whether as players or on the sidelines the lta has always done an exceptional job of ensuring that now they ll finally get to play regularly in the cauldron of the cup and confident that will springboard team gb to greater success thomas out of six nations wales captain gareth thomas has been ruled out of the rest of the six nations with broken thumb the full back will have surgery on monday after fracturing his thumb in the win over france on saturday but welsh legend phil bennett insisted wales can cope without thomas as they chase first grand slam in years bennett told bbc sport such is the spirit in the camp they ll put kevin morgan at rhys williams at wing and just carry on thomas will miss the match against scotland on march and what promises to be huge encounter against the irish six days later bennett added it setback he great captain he leads from the front and the boys love him thomas was replaced at half time by williams as his side turned around deficit in paris with gareth missing would think michael owen will be our captain said wales coach mike ruddock he did great job in the second half in france he has been vice captain all along throughout the championship wales travel to edinburgh to take on scotland in fortnight and then host ireland in cardiff in the final round of matches in what could be the grand slam and championship decider bennett an inspirational fly half for llanelli and wales in the insisted the national team were entering new golden period it was great game and magnificent result for wales bennett told bbc radio five live sportsweek programme the way this young team are blending the glory days are on their way back we couldn get possession early on and france dominated and scored two tries had they been ruthless wales could have gone into the interval points down but they didn take their chances wales defended fairly well but you cannot give that sort of quality ball to good sides the all blacks would have been ruthless and buried us in the first half but the character we showed in the second half was quite outstanding record fails to lift lacklustre meet yelena isinbayeva may have produced another world pole vault record but her achievement could not hide the fact it was not the best meet we have ever seen in birmingham and hey there are not many meets that go by without the russian breaking world record apparently isinbayeva has cleared five metres in training and would just love her to put us out of our misery and have go at it rather than extending the indoor record by one centimetre at time athletics to me is all about pushing the barriers and being the best you can and would like to see her have go at in competition mind you every time she breaks the record she gets so she can afford to be deliberate about it world records aside thought it was very encouraging evening work for kelly holmes she looked good and was very positive agnes samaria who came second is in very good shape and is in the world top three runners this season yes samaria let kelly get away but there was no coming back over the last as kelly dominated the race so beating samaria is bit of benchmark for kelly my gut feeling is that kelly would like to run in the european indoor championships but she just hasn convinced herself she is fit enough to do so on the other hand think jason gardener is struggling to come near what is going to be required to win the men in madrid he started well in the final but still could not stay with the front runners jason has lot of experience indoors but for some reason he is struggling to maintain his pace through to the finish it would have been nice to see what mark lewis francis could have done in the final if only he hadn got himself disqualified he was blatantly playing the false start game to his advantage but it tripped him up and made him look bit silly my view is you re meant to go when the gun goes and not before and if you try to unsettle your rivals by employing the false start tactic you have to remember not to false start yourself again having said that mark is looking in much better shape but haven seen anything from mark or jason yet which suggests france ronald pognon who has run seconds will be under threat at the europeans from british point of view sarah claxton victory in the hurdles was the best thing to come out of the meet something else that probably went unnoticed was melanie purkiss winning the women national race in new personal best of seconds aaas champion kim wall came second in another lifetime best so we have very strong squad going to the european championships scotland lee mcconnell is probably going to run too so we have real prospect of medal from an international perspective thought meseret defar was disappointing in the but don think the pace making was great canadian heather hennigar set fast early pace but could not maintain it and if jo pavey had been in last year shape she would have given defar real run for her money she had go but just could not hang in there we were also expecting bit more from bernard lagat in the men but he has only just come over from the usa so he may not be that sharp and still think he is in great shape as for kenenisa bekele he was well beaten by markos geneti but we only had half expectations for bekele as he has been struggling this season it was very hot in the national indoor arena and felt uncomfortable in the commentary box think those conditions affected the distance runners and in fact defar complained to her coach after the race that she could not get her breath properly spain coach faces racism inquiry spain football federation has initiated disciplinary action against national coach luis aragones over racist comments about thierry henry if found guilty aragones could lose his job or face fine of about the federation had initially declined to take action against aragones after comments he made during national team training session in october but its president angel maria villar changed his mind after request by spain anti violence commission aragones insisted the comments made to henry arsenal club mate jose antonio reyes were meant to motivate the player and were not intended to be offensive never intended to offend anyone and for that reason have very easy conscience he said at the time obliged to motivate my players to get the best results as part of that job use colloquial language with which we can all understand each other within the framework of the football world england players made point of wearing anti racism shirts when training before their friendly against spain in madrid last month but the storm increased following racist chanting by spanish fans at england black players during the game which spain won spain minister of sport jaime lissavetzky was quick to give his backing to the federation decision everyone who has public function has to consider their declarations and make sure they do not give negative image he said we are going to have zero tolerance in questions of racism laporte tinkers with team france coach bernard laporte has made four changes to the starting line up that beat england for saturday six nations clash with wales he opted for yannick nyanga in the back row instead of grand slam winner imanol harinordoquy who is back in the squad other changes see julien laharrague win his first cap at full back aurelien rougerie return after injury on the wing and yannick jauzion in at centre but laporte has resisted fan pressure to start frederic michalak at fly half the dependable yann delaigue keeps the number jersey despite clamours for the flair of michalak the year old laharrague gets his chance despite playing on the wing for his club brive we are launching him into the great international level said team manager jo maso he is young and this is great opportunity for us and above all for him there are matches left before the world cup so we must see as many players as possible the competition is very high and open jauzion france player of the year in would probably have played in the first two matches instead of the south african born liebeneberg had he been fit the stade toulousain star wins his rd cap and is reunited with damien traille with whom he forged an effective midfield in the return of jauzion is going to be plus for us said laporte we are going to test him at an international level julien laharrague brive aurelien rougerie clermont yannick jauzion stade

has offered chelsea boss jose mourinho some advice on coping under pressure the pair worked together at barcelona and porto and robson had word of warning for his protege it has all gone for him just lately and that is marvellous but sometimes you have to have bit of humility and learn how to lose said robson it is when it goes against you and you get bit of bad luck that you learn and he ll get it straight robson was speaking after being formally granted the freedom of the city of newcastle jose is doing very well at the moment robson added of the man who worked for him for six years he has got one pot possibly two to follow big game against barcelona to come and cannot see them losing their lead in the premiership they are in good position and would expect them to go on and win it which is wonderful achievement what has occurred over the last couple of weeks will stand him in very good stead for the future if he is intelligent he will take it on board and he is very intelligent he will have learned more in the last fortnight than the last eight months before that it was all about winning robson also admitted he would relish the chance to get back into management and test his skills against mourinho am not in hurry to take the wrong job but am ready to take the right job and feel there is another job in me he added know the area am capable of working in and of course would like job in the premiership if one was available it would not worry me if had to pit my wits against jose but it is not just case of him and me against one another it would be his team against my team but would not be afraid of that bortolami predicts dour contest italy skipper marco bortolami believes saturday six nations contest against scotland will be scrappy encounter with both sides looking for their first win of the championship the third round game at murrayfield has been billed as wooden spoon decider and bortolami feels the edinburgh contest could end up being bruising battle of the packs it will not be pretty game because both teams are desperate to gain their first win said the lock forward italy have only recorded three wins since they joined the six nations in but two of those have come against scotland this year italy opened up with stubborn display against ireland but ended up losing however they were thoroughly outplayed by an impressive welsh side in rome last time out now the italians travel to edinburgh hoping to claim their first away win in the six nations scotland played extremely well against france in paris but not so well when ireland came to edinburgh said bortolami we are still very disappointed with our last game against wales in rome and we are thoroughly determined to right the wrongs as nation our quest is to be respected as team worthy of place in this tournament and we can only do this by winning games aragones angered by racism fine spain coach luis aragones is furious after being fined by the spanish football federation for his comments about thierry henry the year old criticised his euros punishment even though it was far below the maximum penalty am not guilty nor do accept being judged for actions against the image of the sport he said not racist and ve never lacked sporting decorum ve never done that and have medals for sporting merit aragones was handed the fine on tuesday after making racist remarks about henry to arsenal team mate and spanish international jose reyes last october the spanish football federation at first declined to take action against aragones but was then requested to do so by spain anti violence commission the fine was far less than the expected amount of about or even the suspension of his coaching licence arsenal boss arsene wenger who was fined in december for accusing manchester united striker ruud van nistelrooy of cheating believes that aragones punishment was too lenient you compare his fine and my fine and if you consider his was for racist abuse then you seem to get away with it more in spain than you should wenger said he shouldn have said what he said and how much money is enough don know but it doesn look big punishment however aragones insists the fine is unjustified and unfair have been treated like islero the bull that killed famous bullfighter manolete said aragones on hearing he had been fined for his actions have not liked one thing about this whole affair and do not agree with the sanction they have looked for scapegoat spain anti violence commission must now ratify the spanish fa decision and has until next week to announce its verdict aragones has days to appeal and the commission can also appeal alberto flores president of the spanish fa disciplinary committee said no one in the committee felt aragones was racist nor had acted in racist way fine the highest we could apply is sufficient punishment suspension would have been bit exaggerated flores told sports daily marca woodward eyes brennan for lions toulouse former irish international trevor brennan could be one of clive woodward many surprises when the man lions tour squad is announced brennan who last played for ireland against samoa in is held in high esteem by the former england coach if you speak to the players there huge amount of respect for the guy woodward told the sunday independent players tend to know better than most coaches it not just the irish but welsh and english players as well the year old former dublin milkman moved from leinster to toulouse in and immediately picked up heineken cup winner medal in an all french final against perpignan at lansdowne road brennan is highly rated at stade toulousain where he is used anywhere in the back five woodward is ensuring his preparations for the trip to new zealand in june are as thorough as possible ve spoken to quite few players and they probably don know what they re actually saying when we re having these conversations he told the newspaper but you talk about certain players and they ll say if they think they re up to scratch or that they don want them in their team haven heard bad word said against trevor which considering he has pretty tough guy reputation is to me impressive radcliffe eyes hard line on drugs paula radcliffe has called for all athletes found guilty on drugs charges to be treated as criminals the marathon world record holder believes more needs to be done to rid athletics of the suspicions and innuendoes which greet any fast time doping in sport is criminal offence and should be treated as such the year old told the sunday times it not only cheats other athletes but also cheats promoters sponsors and the general public radcliffe comments come at time when several american sports stars are under suspicion of steroid use being caught in possession of performance enhancing drugs should carry penalty she added the current system does not detect many of the substances being abused by athletes this means that often athletes do not know if they are competing on level playing field if their hard work and sacrifice is being trumped by an easier scientific route often when an athlete puts in good performance they are subjected to suspicions and innuendoes instead of praise having been on the receiving end of accusations like this can testify as to how much this hurts edu describes tunnel fracas arsenal edu has lifted the lid on the scenes that followed manchester united win over the gunners the brazilian confirmed tempers had flared but could shed no light on reports that food was thrown at united boss sir alex ferguson saw people being pulled apart people pushing pointing and shouting he told uefa official website the united players were trying to wind us up about the result but didn see any soup being thrown at anyone however edu tried to play down the incidents adding there was nothing that haven seen in brazilian derbies derby matches in brazil are worse like to play in games like this with this intense rivalry but edu was highly critical of the ferocity of some of united challenges during the game particularly on jose antonio reyes think we were lot fairer in the tackles than united he said reyes was being kicked all over the park they were beating up the boy and gary neville was tackling in such way that he should have been sent off following the game the football association said it would look into events in the tunnel it also charged ruud van nistelrooy with serious foul play while arsenal boss arsene wenger has been asked to explain comments he made about the referee qpr keeper day heads for preston queens park rangers keeper chris day is set to join preston on month loan day has been displaced by the arrival of simon royce who is in his second month on loan from charlton qpr have also signed italian generoso rossi manager ian holloway said some might say it risk as he can be recalled during that month and simon royce can now be recalled by charlton but have other irons in the fire have had yes from couple of others should need them day rangers contract expires in the summer meanwhile holloway is hoping to complete the signing of middlesbrough defender andy davies either permanently or again on loan before saturday match at ipswich davies impressed during recent loan spell at loftus road holloway is also chasing bristol city midfielder tom doherty tigers wary of farrell gamble leicester say they will not be rushed into making bid for andy farrell should the great britain rugby league captain decide to switch codes we and anybody else involved in the process are still some way away from going to the next stage tigers boss john wells told bbc radio leicester at the moment there are still lot of unknowns about andy farrell not least his medical situation whoever does take him on is going to take big big gamble farrell who has had persistent knee problems had an operation on his knee five weeks ago and is expected to be out for another three months leicester and saracens are believed to head the list of rugby union clubs interested in signing farrell if he decides to move to the man game if he does move across to union wells believes he would better off playing in the backs at least initially sure he could make the step between league and union by being involved in the centre said wells think england would prefer him to progress to position in the back row where they can make use of some of his rugby league skills within the forwards the jury is out on whether he can cross that divide at this club the balance will have to be struck between the cost of that gamble and the option of bringing in ready made replacement lennon brands rangers favourites celtic neil lennon admits rangers could be considered slight favourites for the old firm cis cup clash but insists his side can still win lennon concedes rangers are in good form at the moment but they have failed to beat celtic in their last seven meetings rangers are on the up and have been on good run in recent weeks he said but it game we believe we re capable of winning if we play our best he told the evening times all the boys are looking forward to it because they are brilliant games to be involved in without playing at the top of our game we have still been winning matches at the minute we are at the top of the league and still in with chance of staying in europe so don think it is the crisis people have been trying to make out of course it is concern when you are losing goals because we have been notorious for being team that is hard to beat and keeping clean sheets but hopefully we are over that wee run considering we lost henrik larsson at the end of last season we have still been scoring lot of goals which is pleasing fa charges liverpool and millwall liverpool and millwall have been charged by the football association over crowd trouble during their carling cup match on october millwall who lost the match have also been charged over alleged racist behaviour by their supporters during the match at millwall new den stadium seats were ripped up and four people were ejected from the ground disabled fan was injured at the perimeter of the pitch and riot police were needed to control the situation liverpool fans claimed the trouble was sparked by chants about the hillsborough disaster where supporters were crushed to death in april but lions chairman theo paphitis has denied the claims he has said cctv footage showed the catalyst for the trouble was liverpool fan attacking millwall fan in the west stand however millwall have been charged with two breaches of fa rules they have been charged with failing to ensure that fans refrained from racist and or abusive behaviour and for failing to prevent spectators throwing missiles onto the pitch liverpool have been charged with one breach for failing to prevent their fans conducting themselves in threatening and or violent and or provocative behaviour both clubs have until december to respond an irish athletics year won be remembered as one of irish athletics great years the year began with that optimism which invariably and unaccountably seems to herald an upcoming olympiad but come late august few hot days in the magnificent stadium in athens told us of the true strength of irish athletics or to be more accurate the lack of it sonia sullivan olympic farewell apart there was little to stir the emotions of irish athletics watchers but after the disastrous build up to the games we shouldn have been surprised at the start of the year an sullivan had been earmarked as ireland best medal prospect but as it turned out walker gillian never even made it to the start line because of injury less than week before the olympics the sport was rocked by news that hope cathal lombard had tested for the banned substance epo lombard shattering of mark carroll national record in april had already set tongues wagging but even the most cynical of observers were surprised when he was rumbled after an irish sports council sting operation the corkman quickly held his hands up in admission and was promptly handed two year ban from the sport back at pre olympic ranch in greece it must have seemed that things couldn have got any worse but they very nearly did with walker jamie costin lucky to escape with his life after being involved in car crash near athens once the track and field action began in athens familiar pattern of underachievement emerged although alistair cragg performance in being the only athlete from european nation to qualify for the final did offer hope for the future our beloved sonia scraped into the women final as fastest loser and for couple of days the country attempted to delude itself into believing that she might be in the medal shake up as it happened she went out the back door early in the final although there was nothing undignified about the way that she insisted on finishing the race over minute behind winner meseret defar it later transpired that sonia had been suffering from stomach bug in the hours before the final although typically the cobhwoman played down the effects of the illness amazingly she was back in action couple of weeks later when beating world class field at the flora lite road race in london and while her major championship days may be over it unlikely that we have seen the last of her in competition at least sonia managed to make it to athens at the start of the year several northern ireland athletes had genuine hopes of qualifying for the games but come august an out of form and injured paul brizzel was the lone standard bearer for the province the ballymena man gave it lash but his achilles problem and bad lane draw meant time of and an early exit james mcilroy gareth turnbull zoe brown and paul mckee all had to be content with watching the athens action on their television screens hope mcilroy never got near his best during the summer and fourth place in the british trials effectively ended his hopes of making the plane the injury plagued turnbull gamely travelled round europe in search of the qualifying mark but was the best he could achieve after missing several months training during the previous winter lingering hamstring probem and virus wrecked mckee athens ambitions and both he and turnbull deserve slice of better fortune in pole vaulter brown had hoped for vote of confidence from the british selectors after she had achieved the athens standard but the call never came as the summer ended stalwarts catherina mckiernan and dermot donnelly hung up their competitive spikes mckiernan had to candidly acknowledge that time had crept up on her after several injury ravaged years donnelly and his annadale striders team mates later suffered tragedy when their friend and clubman andy campbell was found dead at his home on december large turnout of athletics loving folk turned out in west belfast to offer their respects to the campbell family and andy many friends as only death can it put the year athletics happenings in sharp perspective jones files lawsuit against conte marion jones has filed lawsuit for defamation against balco boss victor conte following his allegations that he gave her performance enhancing drugs the sydney olympic gold medallist says conte damaged her reputation and she is seeking in the suit conte whose company is at the centre of doping investigation made the claims in us television programme he and three others were indicted in february by federal grand jury for variety of alleged offences in an email to the associated press on wednesday conte said stand by everything said jones won three gold medals and two bronzes in sydney in her lawsuit filed in the us district court in san francisco said the sprinter had passed lie detector test and that she has never taken banned performance enhancing drugs conte statements the suit added were false and malicious after the abc television program earlier this month jones lawyer richard nicholls said marion has steadfastly maintained her position throughout she has never ever used performance enhancing drugs victor conte is man facing count federal indictment while marion jones is one of america most decorated female athletes mr conte statements have been wildly contradictory mr conte chose to make unsubstantiated allegations on television while marion jones demanded to take and then passed lie detector examination mr conte is simply not credible we challenge him to submit to the same lie detector procedure that marion jones passed the sport ruling body the iaaf is taking cautious approach to conte allegations but contacted the us anti doping agency communications director nick davies said the iaaf would seek to contact conte for further information but davies stressed it would be up to the american authorities to decide whether they will take action against jones in light of conte television interview and the world governing body would monitor the situation closely if it is felt there is case to answer it would be for its national governing body usa track and field to take the appropriate disciplinary action he added the us anti doping agency has proved itself to be very diligent in its anti doping war and am sure like ourselves they will be watching the television programme with great interest jones who is under investigation for steroid use by the us anti doping agency has continually denied ever taking illegal substances since being investigated in the balco scandal although she praised zinc supplement conte marketed jones who did not win any medals in athens in august has never failed drugs test meanwhile conte who has been charged along with three other men of distributing illegal steroids and money laundering is due to face trial in march robinson wants dual code success england rugby union captain jason robinson has targeted dual code success over australia on saturday robinson former rugby league international before switching codes in leads england against australia at twickenham at gmt and at gmt great britain rugby league team take on australia in the final of the tri nations tournament beating the aussies in both games would be massive achievement especially for league said robinson england have the chance to seal their third autumn international victory after successive wins over canada and south africa as well as gaining revenge for june hammering by the wallabies meanwhile great britain could end years of failure against australia with victory at elland road britain have won individual test matches but have failed to secure any silverware or win the ashes with series victory since they have great opportunity to land trophy and it would be massive boost for rugby league in this country if we won said robinson know the boys can do it they ve defeated the aussies once already in the tri nations but robinson was not losing sight of the task facing his england side in their final autumn international for us we ve played two and won two this november he said if we beat australia it would be the end to great autumn series for england if we stumble then we ll be looking back with few regrets robinson also revealed that the union side had sent the great britain team good luck message ahead of the showdown in leeds we signed card for them today and will write them an email on saturday wishing them all the best said robinson everyone has signed the card lot of the guys watch league and we support them fully both games will be very tough and hopefully we ll both do well wales silent on grand slam talk rhys williams says wales are still not thinking of winning the grand slam despite third six nations win that the last thing on our minds at the moment said williams second half replacement in saturday win over france in paris we all realise how difficult task it is to go up to scotland and beat them we ve come unstuck there couple of times recently so our focus is on that game and we ll worry about ireland hopefully after we ve beaten scotland with captain gareth thomas ruled out of the rest of the campaign with broken thumb williams is vying for his first start in the championship so far kevin morgan is probably favourite to replace thomas at full back leaving williams and hal luscombe to battle for the right wing berth hamstring injury denied luscombe the opportunity to make third successive start but the dragons winger is expected to be fit for the trip to murrayfield on march hooker robin mcbryde is doubtful after picking up knee injury in paris but centre sonny parker and flanker colin charvis are set to recover from injury to be in contention for selection said wales assistant coach scott johnson they ve worked through the weekend and the reports are bit more positive so we re getting couple back and that adds to the depth of the squad scotland secured their first win of the campaign on saturday by grinding out an win over italy matt williams side has shown little in attack but johnson insisted the scots will be difficult opposition to break down italy are really brave opposition and sometimes it very hard to win he said so an ugly win can be just as effective as or point victory scotland are hard side and very underrated so we re not taking anything for granted we re not basking in the glory of winning our first three games we ve got to be diligent in our preparation that my job and we ve got to make sure we re focused robinson answers critics england captain jason robinson has rubbished suggestions that the world champions are team in decline england were beaten by wales in their six nations opener in cardiff last week and face current champions france at twickenham on sunday robinson said we are certainly not on the decline you lose one game and it doesn make you bad team have no doubt in the players we ve got we have still got the team to go out and beat anyone on our day england find themselves striving to avoid third successive championship defeat for the first time since but full back robinson believes the new look england team can stop the rot against france last weekend we should have won the game he said but if we can under perform and lose by only two points then am sure if we play well this week we will get the win we need we proved that in the autumn when we put in some excellent performances and we just need to build on that it was disappointing start against wales and we might be down on that but we are certainly not out we will come out fighting this week robinson also had words of comfort for year old newcastle centre mathew tait who made his international debut against wales but has been demoted from the squad to face france have had word with mathew said robinson still believe in him he is an outstanding player but we have gone for olly barkley because of the kicking mathew has just got to take it on the chin keep working hard like he is doing and sure he will feature in some of the games gara revels in ireland victory ireland fly half ronan gara hailed his side victory over england as special win the munster number kicked total of points including two drop goals to help keep alive their grand slam hopes he told bbc sport we made hard work of it but it still special to beat england had three chances to win the game but didn we have work to do after this but we never take victory over england lightly ireland hooker shane byrne echoed gara comments but admitted the game had been england best outing in the six nations byrne said it was really really hard game but from one to in our team we worked really really hard we just had to stick to our defensive pattern trust ourselves and trust those around us all round it was fantastic ireland captain brian driscoll who scored his side only try said we are delighted we felt if we performed well then we would win but with england also having played very well it makes it all the sweeter we did get the bounce of the ball and some days that happens and you ve just got to jump on the back of it ireland coach eddie sullivan was surprised that england coach andy robinson said he was certain mark cueto was onside for disallowed try just before the break andy was sitting two yards from me and couldn see whether he was offside or not so don know how andy could have known said sullivan what do know is that england played well and when that happens it makes very good victory for us we had to defend for long periods and that is all good for the confidence of the team think our try was very well worked it was gem as good try as we have scored for while sullivan also rejected robinson contention england dominated the forward play think we lost one lineout and they lost four or five so don know how that adds up to domination he said driscoll also insisted ireland were happy to handle the pressure of being considered favourites to win the six nations title this season for the first time we have been able to play with the favourites tag he said hopefully we have proved that today and can continue to keep doing so as for my try it was move we had worked on all week there was bit of magic from geordan murphy and it was great break from denis hickie ireland england ireland consigned england to their third straight six nations defeat with stirring victory at lansdowne road second half try from captain brian driscoll and points from ronan gara kept ireland on track for their first grand slam since england scored first through martin corry but had tries from mark cueto and josh lewsey disallowed andy robinson men have now lost nine of their last matches since the world cup final the defeat also heralded england worst run in the championship since ireland last won the title then the five nations in but years on they share top spot in the table on maximum points with wales and eddie sullivan side banished the ghosts of when england were rampant victors in claiming the grand slam at lansdowne road in front of supercharged home crowd on dry but blustery day in dublin ireland tore into the white shirted visitors from the kick off and made their intentions clear when gara landed fourth minute drop goal england took their time to settle but their first real venture into ireland half produced simple score for corry the number eight picked up the ball from the back of ruck and found an absence of green jerseys between himself and the irish line racing yards to touch down england fly half charlie hodgson nailed the conversion from out on the left but almost immediately gara winning his th cap answered with two penalties in quick succession england were awarded penalty of their own on the halfway line after minutes and hodgson the villain at twickenham coolly bisected the posts the first quarter was marked by periods of tactical kicking but it was ireland who were showing more willingness to spread the ball wide to their eager and inventive backs series of probes led by the talismanic driscoll back from hamstring injury resulted in penalty but ireland chose to kick for touch from the line out the ball was recycled back to gara who stroked his second drop goal this time off the right upright as the interval approached wing josh lewsey was the catalyst for england most promising attack the wasps star raced up his touchline and hodgson cross kick put in mark cueto for an apparent score but the sale wing was ruled to have started in front of the kicker england began the second half well and had ireland pinned in their own half but another english indiscretion on rare irish break out awarded gara kick at goal which he missed england pressure continued and wave of attacks saw centre jamie noon dragged down yards from the line before hodgson landed drop goal the lead was shortlived however ireland raced upfield deft handling from the backs including clever dummy from geordan murphy on hodgson ending with driscoll going over in the right corner and touching down close to the posts gara missed penalty which would have put ireland nine points clear and the home crowd breathed sigh of relief when hodgson cross kick was fumbled by lock ben kay near the line anticipation of home win sent the noise level sky high but gara missed another chance to seal the game with wayward drop goal attempt inside the last minutes england poured forward spurred on by scrum half matt dawson who replaced leicester harry ellis but despite one near miss with the pack over the line not checked on the tv replay by referee jonathan kaplan england were unable to pull off face saving win ireland next face france at lansdowne road in two weeks time before the potential title decider against wales in

had doubted whether she had sufficiently recovered from her olympic ordeal just weeks ago but the world record holder was prominent at the head of the field for the whole race as her rivals slowly

managed to hang in both runners looked to be suffering as they reached the final mile in central park but it was radcliffe who managed to dredge up final sprint to see off chepkemei in the closest

association action over the comments he made after their carling cup tie with manchester united mourinho intimated that united boss sir alex ferguson influenced referee neale barry after the duo walked down the tunnel together at half time but an fa spokesman told bbc sport we are not taking action over mourinho we have looked at the comments and we have decided that no further action is required that is the end of it mourinho was concerned that ferguson conversation with barry was followed by an inconsistent display by the official see one referee in the first half and another in the second said mourinho if the fa ask me what happened will tell them what saw and felt made it easier to understand few things maybe when turn and have been managing in the same league for years and have the respect of everybody will have the power to speak to people and make them tremble little bit the referee controlled the game in one way during the first half but in the second they had dozens of free kicks it was fault after fault dive after dive but know the referee did not walk to the dressing rooms alone at half time he should only have had his two assistants and the fourth official with him but there was also someone else referees chief keith hackett believes mourinho should retract his comments about ferguson and barry as he believes the blues boss has questioned their integrity hoping he might reconsider his comments unfortunately this is the nature of the game said hackett don want referees or myself getting in the psychological warfare between two managers for the second leg we have an experienced referee and we should be talking about the quality of that game rather than the refereeing sometimes managers have grounds for comments and note that but referees integrity has been questioned that is offensive and should be avoided mr mourinho should look at the facts mourinho added that the match was entertaining for goalless draw and insisted his team could still reach the final it so if we win we go through and if we get draw we go to extra time he said we have exactly the same chance we had before this game we are confident of getting result but we know what manchester united is footballing power it ll be difficult for us but also for them gb select holmes for double bid kelly holmes has been chosen for both the and at next month european indoor championships despite not yet confirming her availability the double olympic champion is still undecided about whether to compete in her first european indoors in madrid but uk athletics chief max jones believes it is likely holmes will race he said it worth punt isn it she gone back to training if she confident she will pick one distance the programme does not permit both if holmes does take her place in the gb side she has already indicated that will be her favoured distance under championship rules she does not have to decide until hours before the event begins in madrid on march jones added she was pleased with her run in birmingham at last weekend grand prix am inclined to think she will compete it could depend on how training goes and she will have to be close to top form and he admitted holmes presence would be great boost to the rest of the norwich union gb team she is very good team member and is very good to have there he added meanwhile there is no surprises in the rest of the great britain team announced on tuesday defending champion jason gardener is included and will be chasing his third successive gold medal he will be joined in the event by mark lewis francis

jones before he retires to be succeeded by dave collins jones said the olympic games is the overwhelming target for uka and therefore it is beneficial to start the next four year cycle with not so pressurised major games the european indoor championships always provide chance for the young and inexperienced to make name for themselves and the current indoor season has produced some exciting new

gerrard has reiterated his desire to stay at anfield and win trophies with the club the year old england midfielder is determined to see out his contract despite reported interest from chelsea he said signed here for this season and another two so there is no situation there lot of speculation but that not down to me as club captain all want to do is help us get back up the table and into the champions league again gerrard looked set to move to chelsea during the summer and speculation of switch to stamford bridge has again arisen with the january transfer window approaching he raised doubts about his reds future when he said he wanted the club to prove they were title challengers in the very near future or he might leave liverpool boss rafael benitez has insisted that gerrard has promised him he wants to stay at anfield benitez said said to steven that was sure he wanted to stay here and he said do then said to him look if you want to win titles you want medals and you want liverpool to have these things then am going to need your help really think he wants to stay so now what we must do is make the squad stronger for him meanwhile gerrard has urged the anfield board to sign real madrid striker fernando morientes in the january transfer window morientes has already expressed willingness to come to england gerrard added he great player he scores goals in the league in cup competitions and also in the champions league don think he be able to play for us in europe this season but if we are able to get hold of him we be getting ourselves great player he have spanish coaches spanish manager and we have got three or four spanish players here now so they ll help him settle in rafael benitez knows what he wants and he knows how to strengthen the squad he got and if the right players become available at the right price am sure we will strengthen it would certainly be nice to see few new faces in january to freshen things up spurs to sign iceland star tottenham are primed to snap up iceland under international emil hallfredsson after he impressed on trial at white hart lane the year old midfielder who plays for fh hafnarfjordur also starred in the uefa cup match against scottish side dunfermline earlier this season spurs have agreed fee for the player who has yet to agree personal terms he had offers from two other clubs but he decided to come to tottenham said spurs sporting director frank arnesen he is left sided player position we have been looking at and he showed so much talent in his time here that we decided to take him it down the road of bringing in talent good prospects and giving them place at tottenham where they can improve benitez delight after crucial win liverpool manager rafael benitez admitted victory against deportivo la coruna was vital in their tight champions league group jorge andrade early own goal gave liverpool win and benitez said we started at very high tempo and had many chances it is very important win for us and we could have scored more goals we were very good defensively and also good on the counter attack we are pleased but move on to the next game igor biscan was outstanding in midfield after replacing injured xabi alonso and benitez said he played very well it is important to have all the players ready and good squad so you can play more games at high level benitez added it is all back in our own hands now it was great win for us and was delighted with what feel was the best liverpool have seen as far as my feelings about winning in spain that is really not important want to see us win away matches in the champions league that it was in spain was not my first consideration as far as am concerned it is important for liverpool to win it is not important in what country it is in benitez added benitez said we had problem before the start it was decided that xabi could not play more than minutes but in the end because of the way that dietmar hamann and igor biscan performed we did not need to change things until right at the end of the match depor are good team and if you allow them to keep possession they can be very dangerous indeed but we knew that if we hit them on the counter attack it would make them nervous and that is how it worked out deportivo coach javier irureta said liverpool played very well and we just could not break them down know we have now gone six games at home in europe without scoring but that does not reflect our overall performances but this time we did not play well and we lacked imagination the goal was bad mistake and big blow to our confidence players who usually want the ball at that stage did not want it know we are bottom of the group but as long as there is hope of qualifying we will hang on to that serena becomes world number two serena williams has moved up five places to second in the world rankings after her australian open win williams won her first grand slam title since with victory over lindsay davenport the world number one men champion marat safin remains fourth in the atp rankings while beaten finalist lleyton hewitt replaces andy roddick as world number two roger federer retains top spot but safin has overtaken hewitt to become the new leader of the champions race alicia molik who lost three set thriller against davenport in the quarter finals is in the women top for the first time in her career her rise means australia have player in the top of the men and women rankings for the first time in years and britain elena baltacha who qualified and then reached the third round has risen to in the world leap of places and her highest ranking yet kirwan demands italy consistency italy coach john kirwan has challenged his side to match the performance they produced in pushing ireland close when they meet wales on saturday despite losing in sunday six nations encounter the italians confirmed their continuing improvement our goal is to match every side we face and against ireland we showed we could do that said kirwan but the most important thing is that we build on that performance when we play wales on saturday italy half backs had mixed afternoon with recalled scrum half alessandro troncon impressing but fly half luciano orquera having an off day with the boot kirwan said was very happy with troncon he had an incredible game he was very good in attack and defence orquera kicking was off but he showed great courage in defence he also followed the game plan we have to give him confidence because he has the capability to do well henin hardenne beaten on comeback justine henin

positive still have few weeks she said my body has to get accustomed again to the stress the rhythm henin hardenne slid down the world rankings in the second half of after contracting the illness in april after an initial lay off she was forced off the circuit for second time after being knocked out of the french open in the second round comeback at the us open after three month absence ended when she crashed out at the fourth round stage but despite her problems she still won five of the nine official tournaments she entered in and won olympic gold in athens an achievement which saw her named belgian sportswoman of the year on friday physically it obvious that hit rock bottom said the year old who will make her comeback in the sydney international from january since april with the exception of the olympics have not done much all the successes had prior to that were mainly due to the work put in on building up my fitness now it time to get back to putting in effort and think am capable of doing that campbell to extend sprint career darren campbell has set his sights on running quicker than ever after deciding not to retire from sprinting campbell who won olympic relay gold had been unsure about his future but he told five live sportsweek had to get back into training before could decide because if didn have the same hunger have to walk away ve started back and thoroughly enjoying it looking forward to it ve got to run under seconds for and under seconds for campbell was part of the british quartet who shocked the americans to win relay gold in athens in august the newport based athlete and team mates jason gardener marlon devonish and mark lewis francis were rewarded with mbes in the new year honours list campbell relay triumph made up for his disappointing displays in the individual and events in athens when he failed to reach the finals the year old who won olympic silver in sydney in said during the games that hamstring injury had stopped him from running at his best he was criticised at the time by former olympic champion michael johnson who cast doubt on campbell injury claims to go to athens and finally get the gold ve been trying to get for years was big relief said campbell it was chance for me to prove that if been fit would have been challenging for the individual medals every season go and challenge for the medals so why would last season have been any different it just unfortunate that picked up that injury just before the olympics campbell set his personal best of secs when he won the european title in budapest in and he ran secs in the quarter finals of the in sydney on the way to olympic silver big guns ease through in san jose top seeded americans andy roddick and andre agassi survived minor

hyung taik lee before pulling out win in san jose california seventh seed jurgen melzer came through against xavier malisse winner in delray beach last week frenchman cyril saulnier meanwhile fired aces to secure win over czech qualifier tomas zib roddick broke racket in frustration in the third game of the second set and afterwards was unimpressed with his form not playing great he said but through and going to keep battling lot of people are under the assumption that it easy to play well every week and it not it is the th time in appearances at the event that agassi now has progressed to the quarter final stage he came from down in the opening game to hold serve and gradually wore carlsen down after attacking his backhand agassi also employed several lobs and charged to the net to unsettle the year old dane ranked th in the world as the match went on got real patient and waited for my opportunities and felt pretty good said agassi hodgson relishes european clashes former blackburn boss roy hodgson says the premiership should follow the rest of europe and have winter break but insists that gruelling domestic schedule will not damage the english elite bid for champions league glory hodgson now in charge at viking stavanger was at liverpool clash with bayer leverkusen at anfield on tuesday as member of uefa technical committee hodgson is fierce advocate of the winter break employed throughout europe although not in england where the champions league contenders have ploughed through heavy fixture list but hodgson told bbc sport that while he believes the premiership should embrace the idea he does not expect it to cost the english representatives in the last of the champions league just feel it is very difficult to say with certainty that teams who have had the break will have definite edge am fervent supporter of the break it gives players the chance to recharge their batteries midway through the season which some suggest will give teams an advantage in the champions league the other school of thought suggests having break then coming back to it puts you at disadvantage the bigger discussions around the winter break should be to do with the nature of football today the needs of football players and the way the premiership has developed rather than one or two matches in the champions league in february hodgson believes winter break carries many advantages explaining as said it is the perfect chance to recharge batteries and certainly if was still manager in england would be supporting any calls for its introduction in pre season you get lot of enthusiasm and energy but by the time you get towards christmas many players having also played plenty of international matches for club and country and travelled lot find themselves getting very jaded the break gives them chance to recover that energy and enthusiasm and perhaps more importantly recover their mental strength during the break and get ready for the games ahead the mental side is by far the most important thing hodgson added the length of breaks can vary in italy the break was very short you just took christmas and new year it was so short you didn do anything you gave the players week or days off then you were training for week or days and then went into game if it is longer it is important those responsible for physical fitness give the players programme to follow to ensure the physical strength they have accumulated stays with them and hodgson believes winter break would be positive step in the premiership he said if we talk about football at elite level which the premiership is then would support winter break if you examine the demands of the premier league and in particular on players who play international football for their club and country then break would do them the world of good physically and mentally mido makes third apology ahmed mido hossam has made another apology to the egyptian people in an attempt to rejoin the national team the year old told news conference in cairo on sunday that he is sorry for the problems that have led to his exclusion from the pharaohs since july last year mido said there isn much have to say today all there is to say is that came specially from england to egypt to rejoin the national team and to apologise for all my mistakes mido was axed by former coach marco tardelli after failing to answer national call up claiming he had groin injury but he then played in friendly for his club as roma within hours of world cup qualifying match at home to cameroon last september mido added it not my right to give orders and say when want to play at the same time will always make sure that put the national team matches as my top priority feel that the national players are playing with new spirit as saw them play against belgium egypt won on wednesday and simply want to add to their success do confess that was rude to the egyptian press at times but now have gained more experience and know that will never go anywhere without the press support many of the international stars like david beckham and zinedine zidane had the press opposing them so now used to the fact that the press can be against me at times and don have to overreact when this happens meanwhile egypt fa spokesman methat shalaby welcomed the apology and said no one had exerted pressure on mido to apologise mido apology today does not negatively affect mido in anyway on the contrary it makes him bigger star and role model for all football players shalaby said shalaby earlier said that after an apology mido would be available for the national side if coach hassan shehata chose him mido joined tottenham in an month loan deal near the end of the january transfer window scoring twice on his debut against portsmouth dallaglio his own man to the end controversy and lawrence dallaglio have never been very far away from each other throughout glittering international career even the end of his nine year career came out of the blue just four days before the start of the season but then dallaglio has always been his own man ever since emerging onto the international scene dallaglio has polarised opinions to supporters of england dallaglio could do no wrong an integral part of sustained period of success for england dallaglio crowning glory was his part in the side that won the rugby world cup in rival fans meanwhile have tended to take an alternative view seeing dallaglio as the epitome of the less agreeable characteristics of english rugby never afraid to speak his mind be it to the referee or the opposition on the pitch or his coach or the media off it dallaglio has sometimes rubbed people up the wrong way dallaglio arrived as part of the unheralded england side which became the shock winners of the first rugby sevens world cup in it took him another two years to graduate to the full england xv but once there he proved to the manor born displaying maturity and physical power beyond his years dallaglio rapidly established himself as an automatic choice able to play any one of the three back row positions at international standard within two years of his debut dallaglio was offered the england captain band and his career continued to go from strength to strength as he made the lions tour to south africa although overlooked for the captaincy in favour of england team mate martin johnson he played massive role in the series victory but after building up seemingly unstoppable momentum dallaglio career hit the buffers at speed in first came the last minute defeat to wales in which dallaglio decision not to kick for goal in the dying minutes was blamed for costing england grand slam worse was to follow though as an infamous newspaper sting cost him his treasured england captaincy with sensational allegations of drug use of which he was subsequently cleared splashed across the front pages devastated dallaglio stepped down as england skipper but he bounced back getting his head down at club level before returning to the england fold albeit now as lieutenant to new captain johnson as member of new look england side on the long road to world cup glory journey not without mishaps as succession of grand slams opportunities were spurned dallaglio emerged as key performer once again yet another setback arrived in as serious knee injury cut short dallaglio involvement on the lions tour to australia rumours began to circulate that his career was over but in typical dallaglio style he embarked on punishing schedule of rehabilitation to return an even more fearsome physical specimen one effect of the injury was to rob dallaglio of much of his pace but ever the pragmatist he reinvented himself as close quarters number eight of the highest calibre the only player to play every minute of england world cup triumph in australia dallaglio could hardly have done more to secure england historic win and for that he will always be held in the highest esteem by england supporters following johnson retirement dallaglio career came full circle as woodward restored him as england captain while england did not hit the heights in dallaglio second spell as captain losing five of their eight post world cup tests dallaglio led by example leaving him as one of the few members of squad lacking many world cup stars to live up to expectations dallaglio walks away from the international game safe in the knowledge that he will go down as one of england most accomplished players if not one of the great captains despite his evident pride in leading his country the problem now for england is how to replace the almost irreplaceable the likes of matt dawson jonny wilkinson phil vickery and hill have all been mentioned as contenders for dallaglio role as captain but it is as player that england will really struggle to replace the year old although players like joe worsley and chris jones are more than capable of stepping up the fact that there is no stand out candidate speaks volumes about dallaglio massive influence on english rugby ferguson puts faith in youngsters manchester united manager sir alex ferguson said he has no regrets after his second string side lost away at fenerbahce in the champions league ferguson said the good thing about being manager is that you are in control of which team to pick care about united that important so while am disappointed at the result am not at the team selected this game was important for the young lads they will remember it and next time they come they will be better ferguson admitted his side were well beaten by the turks result which meant they finished second in group behind lyon he added they ll know not to play like that again we showed lack of strength but have no complaints about the scoreline in the second half we had some good moments in attack and in that situation you have to take one chance but we didn do that so the game just petered out for us didn think it made much difference whether we won the group or finished second and still don we could get inter ac milan and juventus but bayern barcelona and real madrid were among the runners up all we can do is let fate decide how it works out bellamy fined after row newcastle have fined their welsh striker craig bellamy two weeks wages about following his row with manager graeme souness but bellamy has not been put on the transfer list although he did not train with the first team on tuesday magpies chairman freddy shepherd told the newcastle evening chronicle it is not about money it is about player thinking he is bigger than this club no individual is be it the chairman the manager or player souness dropped bellamy for sunday game against arsenal claiming the welshman had feigned injury after being asked to play out of position when heard what the manager was saying was in shock bellamy said thought not only has he gone behind my back he lying he said in response to souness remarks and the wales international refused to apologise won apologise because have done nothing wrong he told the evening chronicle there no doubt about it am out of here the difficult relationship between souness and bellamy boiled over at the weekend and has led to war of words in the media bellamy claim that souness had lied about the background to the bust up was strongly denied by shepherd who accused the striker of cheating the club wish to put the record straight regarding the bellamy situation said shepherd craig walked off the training ground saying his hamstring was tight on friday but what he failed to reveal was that he had told other members of the squad before training that he intended to feign injury when graeme discovered this he immediately ordered bellamy to attend meeting in my office at that meeting bellamy admitted to graeme and that he had told the players that he was going to fake an injury in training and walk off he also agreed at that meeting to apologise to his team mates for his behaviour he didn do this which resulted in the action taken by the manager at the weekend which fully support in my book this is cheating on the club the supporters the manager and his own team mates he is paid extremely well and consider his behaviour to be totally unacceptable and totally unprofessional bellamy latest outburst would appear to make his chances of first team recall remote but even before newcastle said the player would not be sold bellamy insisted he had no intention of handing in transfer request don want the fans to think for one minute that wouldn play for this club he said play anywhere for this club even in goal it very difficult situation for me at the moment but never ask to leave this club this club means so much to me couldn do it because know couldn come back here and play against newcastle it would hurt too much hong kong in world cup bid hong kong is hoping to join japan as co host of the rugby world cup japan has applied to host the tournament on its own with the aim of taking it outside rugby traditional strongholds for the first time but hong kong rugby football union hkrfu chairman john molloy has called for the territory to host one of the pools and quarter final the japanese rugby football union jrfu says it has yet to receive formal presentation from the hkrfu at this stage we are only considering hosting the event by ourselves said jrfu secretary koji tokumasu we cannot examine any proposal unless we get it in definitive form japan faces stiff competition in the form of south africa and new zealand to host the event in seven years time until now the world cup has been held in countries from the six nations or tri nations said tokumasu we think and the irb thinks that it is time for rugby to go global japan is ready to host the tournament and we are looking forward to welcoming the world of rugby to japan tokumasu added that the football world cup co hosted by japan and south korea had been huge success as well as having the infrastructure in place japan also has the commercial clout to host one of sport top competitions he said last year japan launched its first professional rugby league and it has the fourth largest number of registered players in the world after england south africa and france bridge could miss rest of season chelsea left back wayne bridge could miss the rest of the season with suspected broken ankle the england international was hurt in an innocuous challenge with alan shearer during the londoners fa cup defeat at newcastle on sunday we think it big injury said jose mourinho whose chelsea team this week meet barcelona in the champions league and liverpool in the carling cup final william gallas and damien duff could also miss the barcelona game france defender gallas and ireland winger duff both picked up their injuries in the closing stages of chelsea defeat at st james park with bridge having gone off after mourinho used all three substitutes those knocks plus carlo cudicini red card meant chelsea finished the game with seven able bodied players cudicini would not have played against barcelona but had been promised game in the carling cup final although he will now miss the cardiff showpiece through suspension the manager is not planning to add any new names to his squad ahead of the trip to barcelona even though he has few options to replace bridge at left back celestine babayaro left the club in january ironically to join newcastle and although gallas has deputised at left back before he is struggling to be fit himself it could be that paulo ferreira usually right back is switched to left back with glen johnson who ended the newcastle game in goal playing on the right youngsters ben hudell joe keenan and sam tillen would be options should mourinho decide to call up replacement but it is unlikely he would risk an untried prospect in champions league tie bridge injury also means mourinho who reportedly wants to sign ashley cole from arsenal will not have specialist senior left back for the run in to the season he bridge has no chance of playing against barcelona probably will not play against liverpool in the carling cup final and maybe not for the rest of the season he said the medical department will try to do everything to recover gallas and duff we will have to wait and see but won cry about injuries because we will have players to play on tuesday shearer said he was unsure what caused bridge injury don know what happened he said it was just shame don think we even touched each other by all accounts it pretty serious went into the dressing room after the game and wished him all the best mourinho whose team are chasing three trophies has already lost winger arjen robben to serious injury tulu to appear at caledonian run two time olympic metres champion derartu tulu has confirmed she will take part in the bupa great caledonian run in edinburgh on may the year old ethiopian is the first star

claim another six nations grand slam despite two lacklustre wins so far against scotland and england the champions only just saw off the scots in paris then needed england to self destruct in last week win the english played better than us but lost whereas we are still in the race for the grand slam said dominici we know our display was not perfect but we can still win the grand slam along with ireland and wales france ireland and wales all remain unbeaten after two rounds of this year rbs six nations with the two celtic nations playing by far the more impressive rugby france take on wales at the stade de france on february and ireland in dublin on march but although france have yet to click dominici says that they can still win the hard way as long as scrum half dimitri yachvili continues in his goalkicking form if we have an efficient kicker on whom we can rely on solid defence and team who play for their lives we can achieve something dominici added said at the start of the competition that the winners would be clearer from the third matches and that exactly what is going to happen france coach bernard laporte will announce his starting line up next tuesday for the match against wales wing jimmy marlu is definitely out with the knee injury sustained at twickenham which is likely to sideline him for the rest of the tournament inspirational flanker serge betsen is doubt

earlier in the season was unable to rest because leary had shortage of strikers the return to fitness of darius vassell after four months out with broken ankle and the emergence of luke moore has alleviated some of the villa manager problems in that department hearts livingston hearts wrapped up their scottish cup quarter final tie against livingston with two goals in the first minutes lee miller scored inside the opening seconds heading over colin meldrum and into the net from jamie mcallister free kick mcallister himself scored the second when he met saul mikoliunas cross at the back post to put the game beyond the visitors craig easton headed in controversial goal after an hour but hearts held on the opening goal came after gus bahoken had clumsily fouled miller yards from goal mcallister floated the free kick into the livi box and miller outjumped the static visiting defence to loop his header from yards over meldrum with just minutes on the clock the home side doubled their lead mikoliunas sprinted down the right crossed to the back post where mcallister raced in to head past meldrum moments later miller came close to grabbing his second with first time drive from yards which skimmed the bar then mcallister picked up pass from stephen simmons and drove an angled shot from yards narrowly past meldrum far post the impressive mikoliunas twice went close before half time low drive was comfortably gathered by meldrum and then he curled left footed shot past the keeper right hand post livi manager richard gough made three changes at the interval bringing on defender goran stanic midfielder gabor vincze and striker ferenc horvath for bahoken derek lilley and mark wilson but in the opening stages of the second period little changed however the west lothian side gave themselves lifeline with controversial goal eric deloumeaux sent jason dair away on the right and he tried to give the ball to mcpake who looked to be in an offside position the livi striker ignored the pass however and dair ran on to it and played easton in at the back post and he headed home from close range the home side called for offside against mcpake but referee alan freeland ignored their claims and pointed to the centre circle livi went all out for the equaliser in the th minute burton brien was hauled back at the edge of the box by neil macfarlane but dair sent his shot

equal prize money for women reacting to disputed comment by all england club chairman tim phillips the american said think it is highly insulting if prize money is taken away somebody think it was mr phillips said they won have money for flowers at wimbledon that insulting an all england club spokesperson denied phillips made the remark insisting he definitely didn say it the statement added it was said by someone else and was humorous aside at the end of radio interview when the conversation had moved to talking about the wimbledon grounds davenport was speaking following the announcement that this week dubai duty free event will join the us and australian opens in offering equal prize money for women you hear about women playing only three sets while men play five said daveport and the best women are never going to beat the best men but it different game you go to watch with the women it doesn make it better or worse hopefully we will be able to change people minds serena williams who is also in dubai added obviously for equal prize money women tennis is exciting men tennis is exciting as well but the women have it right now if you are bringing in the spectators you should be able to reap what everyone else is able to reap sullivan commits to dublin race sonia sullivan will seek to regain her title at the bupa great ireland run on april in dublin the year old was

steve mcclaren hopes that stewart downing did not seriously damage his hamstring during the uefa cup win over graz ak the winger was carried off on stretcher in the closing stages as boro booked their place in the last mcclaren said stewart has tweaked hamstring which is blow for us we will assess it in the morning but delighted with the match result they say in sport you can win ugly and we certainly did mcclaren was relieved to make it through after tough encounter at the riverside to be fair to graz they had gameplan they knocked the ball forward especially in the first half and we struggled to deal with it in the second half we were better but it was frustrating because we got the goal but one slip and they were back in it boro face sporting lisbon for place in the quarter finals after the portuguese side saw off feyenoord on thursday and mcclaren added sporting are technically very good portuguese sides always are but the journey goes on for us and we will now go to their magnificent stadium after the first game here we ll look forward to it goalscorer jimmy floyd hasselbaink added it wasn particularly beautiful match to watch but they made it difficult for us we didn play well at all but you need little bit of luck and think we got that when my shot went through the legs of their goalkeeper would have liked to play in holland that would have been little bit special to me but so is going back to portugal ll be playing against some lads played with at boavista dawson joins england injury list scrum half matt dawson is an injury doubt for england six nations opener against wales next weekend the world cup winner missed wasps loss to bath on saturday after injuring his right calf wasps coach warren gatland said he got fitness test in the week but he got good chance of playing gloucester andy hazell and leicester star lewis moody also received knocks during their respective league matches but should be fit for wales next week if dawson is not fit to face wales robinson will have to choose from gloucester andy gomarsall or leicester youngster harry ellis jamie noon is another player on the sidelines after he limped off in the first half against saracens on friday with dead leg the centre who is in line for first six nations start against wales will have to wait hours before knowing the state of his injury williams battles to aussie title serena williams staged remarkable recovery to beat lindsay davenport and win her second australian open title the champion claimed her seventh grand slam title and her first since wimbledon in williams had looked close to quitting with rib injury when she left the court for treatment after five games she quickly dropped the first set but from in the second found another gear as davenport game collapsed allowing williams to take the title williams later explained her injury problem saying it was the result of lunging for ball early in the first set lindsay had me on the run out wide on my backhand and my back went but eventually was able to come back thank goodness she said davenport paid tribute to williams saying she had tough couple of years and she come back like champion the year old former world number one was in desperate trouble in the early stages as the injury hampered her service action davenport took advantage to race through the opening set and held six break points in game five of the second kept thinking to myself not losing this game said williams afterwards don care if my arm falls off not losing this game and guess that what happened didn want to lose that particular game because it would have given her lot of momentum and lot of confidence despite letting the break points slip away davenport looked comfortable enough at but from up she just folded williams won nine consecutive points for the set and powered through the decider as lacklustre davenport looked to have run out of energy after gruelling two weeks felt like was playing well and in control pretty much of the match said davenport then just had that horrible lapse think serving up and made few errors and opened up the door for her and she just kept going through it at the end think was little bit fatigued but she took advantage of it and kept going she great frontrunner when she gets going gerrard plays down european hopes steven gerrard has admitted that liverpool have little chance of winning the champions league this season the year old reds skipper spoke out ahead of tuesday first leg at home to bayer leverkusen in the last which he will miss through suspension let be realistic there are some fantastic teams left in the champions league he told bbc radio five live we are just going to try to stay in as long as possible but we realise that maybe it is not our year this year gerrard has made no secret of his desire to be involved in europe premier club competition last season he described qualification for the champions league as the be all and end all and rumours persist that he will leave anfield if the reds fail to secure place in the competition he has consistently been linked with move away from liverpool with chelsea the favourites to snap up the england midfielder and blues boss jose mourinho backed gerrard view that rafael benitez team could struggle to progress this season rafa has still time in front of him to build an even better team maybe he little bit behind right now he told bbc radio five live gerrard who fired liverpool into the last of this season competition with brilliant goal in december win over olympiakos insisted he was still fully focused on helping liverpool to glory this season the reds are currently fifth in the premiership table five points off the crucial fourth spot which brings champions league qualification and they face chelsea in sunday carling cup final it big couple of months for liverpool he added we re fighting for the fourth spot for the champions league for next season but we are still involved in two cup competitions which are very important we are confident we can upset chelsea in the carling cup final and get to the last eight of the champions league because financially it is big for the club and personally for myself it is very good melzer shocks agassi second seed andre agassi suffered comprehensive defeat by jurgen melzer in the quarter finals of the sap open agassi was often bamboozled by the austrian drop shots in san jose losing defending champion and top seed andy roddick rallied to beat sweden thomas enqvist but unseeded cyril saulnier beat the fourth seed vincent spadea and tommy haas overcame eighth seed max mirnyi melzer has now beaten agassi in two of their three meetings had good game plan and executed it perfectly he said it always tough to come out to play andre didn want him to play his game he makes you run like dog all over the court and agassi who was more than matched for power by his opponent two handed backhand said melzer was an example of several players on the tour willing to take their chances against him lot more guys are capable of it now said the american he played much better than me that what he did both times had opportunities to loosen myself up agassi added but didn convert on the big points mourinho plots impressive course chelsea win at fulham confirming their position at the premiership summit proves that they now have everything in place to mount serious challenges on all fronts this season they have got strength in depth great players an outstanding manager in jose mourinho and finances no other club in the world can match all they need to add now is the big prizes which as we all know is the most difficult part of all one thing is certain they have put themselves in position to make that leap to success very impressively indeed they beat very tough everton at stamford bridge won at newcastle in the carling cup and then won at fulham which was great result given that they had been showing good form as said winning the major honours is the hardest task of all but in mourinho they have manager who will make it whole lot easier to handle the anticipation and expectation that will come their way now mourinho has won the biggest club prize of all the champions league and that track record and confidence transmits itself to top players it is priceless commodity no one can be anything other than highly impressed by mourinho he is regarded as touch arrogant by some people and maybe he can appear that way but he has the silverware to back up the talk mourinho doesn simply talk good game he won some very big games such as the champions league final with porto some may criticise his talk but the words are backed up with actions ve also found him to be very realistic whenever ve heard him he spent lot of money and it seems to be working and we should remember lots of managers have spent money and it has not worked the buys are now integrating and in arjen robben he has the player who is giving them that extra dimension in the early games he was slaughtered for defensive tactics and yet he was winning games you cannot win titles early on in the season but you can certainly lose them and those points on the board were vital also thought the criticism was very harsh because even though they were not scoring goals they were creating chances by the hatful now they are taking those chances have the double threat of robben and damien duff and things are looking good just wonder if they lack predator particularly with didier drogba injured he was starting to look the part before he was sidelined but you have to feel if chelsea had ruud van nistelrooy they would be even more of safe bet for the title chelsea also have all the tools to go far in the champions league felt they would never have better chance than last season but they have swept all before them in europe so far this season it will now be very interesting to see how mourinho prioritises things but his life will be made easier by the size of chelsea squad have said believed chelsea would win the league this season even when arsenal were flying at the start and have seen nothing to make me change me mind if anything what have seen has confirmed my early impressions and chelsea would have taken encouragement from arsenal rocky defensive display at spurs even though they ran out winners mourinho had his say on that game complaining five four is hockey score not football score in three against three training match if the score reaches send the players back to the dressing rooms as they are not defending properly so to get result like that in game of against is disgraceful on more serious note it was game that merely confirmed the importance of sol campbell to arsenal much criticism has been aimed at pascal cygan but believe the problem lies with the absence of campbell and its overall effect on arsenal defence confidence is crucial factor in defending when you start conceding goals you suddenly get chill in the bones every time the ball comes into the penalty area you think oh no then find your worst fears confirmed arsenal need to reverse the process with or without campbell and get some clean sheets on the board but the return of campbell is key he solidifies the unit has pace and is powerful in the air and on the deck he is vastly experienced and has calming influence on all around him campbell pulls it all together at the back and gets the defence playing as unit chelsea have no such problems at present which is why would still place my money on them to edge out arsenal as champions this season greek sprinters won run again the careers of sprinters kostas kenteris and katerina thanou are over says the boss of the organisation that cleared them of missing drugs test greek athletics federation boss vassilli sevastis told the country parliament believe kenteris and thanou won race again the damage to their commercial interests has been done he added athletics bosses are considering its reponse to the ruling while the athletes face trial in greek court greek prosecutors have brought spearate charges of missing the drugs test and faking motorcycle accident speaking to the greek parliament on tuesday sevastis said that the evidence sent by the international olympic committee and athletics governing body the iaaf was not strong enough for the greek association to find the sprinters guilty we were given the task of getting the snake out if its hole but we were not given any evidence to do it with he said so how can you as greek with your hand on your heart try the athletes he added the athletes are technically free to compete while the iaaf reviews its response to the decision to clear kenteris and thanou but sevastis said it does not matter if they are found guilty at the court of arbitration for sport and the current decision is reversed ferguson urges henry punishment sir alex ferguson has called on the football association to punish arsenal thierry henry for an incident involving gabriel heinze ferguson believes henry deliberately caught heinze on the head with his knee during united controversial win the united boss said it was worse than ruud van nistelrooy foul on ashley cole for which he got three game ban we shall present it to the fa and see what they do the tackle on heinze was terrible he said clubs are permitted to ask the fa to examine specific incidents but information is expected to be provided within hours of the game the clash occurred moments before half time when freddie ljungberg challenge left heinze on the ground on the left touchline henry following the ball attempted to hurdle the argentine but his knee collided with the back of heinze head the striker protested his innocence and referee mike riley deemed the collision accidental ferguson was also upset by arsenal overall discipline during the heated encounter between the two arch rivals and praised his own side behaviour edu produced terrible tackle on scholes that was potential leg breaker he said there were fouls in the game by arsenal seven on heinze five on ronaldo six by vieira and it was only his sixth foul that got him booked phil neville got booked for his first challenge am proud of my players for the way they handled that pressure we have always been good at being gracious in defeat what happened on sunday overshadowed our achievement but then they do it all the time don they sydney to host north south game sydney will host northern versus southern hemisphere charity match in june or july the australian rugby union aru said on wednesday the match will include players from the lions tour of new zealand the australian rugby union has thrown its support behind proposed north south match to raise funds

melbourne earlier this month had inspired the aru we still need to discuss the options with the irb international rugby board the lions and our sanzar south africa new zealand and australia rugby

match that raised for victims of the asian tsunami borders ulster ulster clung on for morale boosting celtic league win over bottom club borders at netherdale on friday night late try by borders substitute jonny weston had set up dramatic finish but the scottish side could not complete the fightback ulster had led with tries from paul steinmetz and bryn cunningham but the irish province failed to add to the tally in the second half and ended up relieved to get the win to lift them to eighth place in the table borders had edged ahead with sixth minute penalty by charlie hore only to hand the visitors the initiative via gift try calum macrae surrendered possession before centre steinmetz sent chip into the danger zone substitute joe pattison who had come on for the injured gareth morton wrongly thought the ball was trickling out of play and eased up on the chase the speedy steinmetz had other ideas and he raced up to get the vital touch in the nick of time giving adam larkin an easy conversion ally warnock clawed back three points for borders but they were soon hit by another double blow first mark blair was yellow carded for killing the ball on the ground and then full back cunningham bagged the second touchdown in the wake of fine work by skipper andy ward larkin again added the extras even worse was to come for borders when larkin kicked two more penalties just before the break the second of which also led to kelly brown being sin binned the hosts gave themselves glimmer of hope immediately after the restart however when warnock struck penalty at the other end and he repeated the feat to set up the tense finale ulster coach mark mccall said he was delighted to get the victory borders are tougher proposition this year in spite of the fact that they have not had victory in some time said mccall in the first minutes we were edgy but in the second minutes we played some of our best rugby this season and scored two good tries morton moffat macrae hore

and italy thanou bullish over drugs hearing katerina thanou is confident she and fellow sprinter kostas kenteris will not be punished for missing drugs tests before the athens olympics the greek pair appeared at hearing on saturday which will determine whether their provisional bans from athletics ruling body the iaaf should stand after five months we finally had the chance to give explanations am confident and optimistic said thanou we presented new evidence to the committee that they were not aware of the athletes lawyer grigoris ioanidis said he believed the independent disciplinary committee set up by the greek athletics federation segas would find them innocent we are almost certain that the charges will be dropped said ioanidis we believe that we have presented case that the charges are unreasonable thanou the olympic women silver medallist and sydney champion kenteris were suspended by the iaaf for missing three drugs tests the third was supposed to take place on the eve of the athens games last august but the pair could not be found in the athletes village they were later taken to hospital after claiming to have been involved in motorcycle accident thanou coach christos tzekos was also suspended by the iaaf we were asked by the disciplinary committee all kinds of questions about the night of august said tzekos we did not leave any gaps as far as am concerned there is no such issue of refusing to be tested and am very optimistic tzekos thanou and kenteris who have all denied the charges can expect decision within month deliberations will start after some additional documents are brought in by thursday said committee chairman kostas panagopoulos estimate that the final ruling will be issued by the end of february arnesen denies rift with santini tottenham sporting director frank arnesen has denied that coach jacques santini resigned because of clash of personalities at white hart lane there had been newspaper speculation that santini had felt undermined by arnesen role at the club it is absolutely not true arnesen told bbc radio five live there is only one thing that made him resign and that is his own personal problems he has talked to me recently and said this matter is absolutely for himself arnesen said he was unable to throw any light onto the problems that caused santini to quit after just games in charge he added jacques has never gone into exactly what it was but trust him in that you have to accept it think we should respect it the plan is now that over the weekend we will have talks with the board and then on monday we will clarify the situation arnesen countered criticism at the timing of the announcement coming less than hours before tottenham premiership fixture with charlton when it comes down to personal problems don think we should talk about timing he said and he also denied reports that santini had been given pay off that is absolute nonsense he is the one who said will go and so he went said the spurs sporting director tottenham structure of having sporting director working alongside coach is based on continental model and arnesen sees no reason why they should change it have confidence in this structure am confident that we have started something here in july and still have lot of confidence in tottenham and what we are doing he said however former spurs and england defender gary stevens said he would not be surprised if the system had caused rift think the problems go lot deeper between the director of football at white hart lane and santini stevens told five live on paper they could have worked together but frank arnesen was very creative forward thinking and expansive player whereas think santini was very much the opposite more case of being organised disciplined and happy not conceding goals that sort of arrangement can work if the two people have the same principles and ideals and work very closely but it seems that has not happened dallaglio eyeing lions tour place former england captain lawrence dallaglio still harbours hopes of place on the british and irish lions tour to new zealand lions coach sir clive woodward has made it clear he will pick his squad to tour next summer based on form shown in the six nations championship but dallaglio who called time on england earlier this year said assure you wouldn let anyone down know what it takes and what have to offer he told the daily telegraph dallaglio toured south africa with the lions in but was forced home early with knee injury from the trip to australia three years ago the year old also felt concentrating on club rugby could have prolonged his international shelf life he said ll be in good shape and fresh without another tests on the clock from what witnessed at close quarters on sunday in our heineken cup match against leicester certainly didn feel out of place alongside those players many of whom will be on the trip if fit and playing well then most certainly available if clive feels he has no need to look outside the international crop then fine if he does then he won need to look too far will he ref stands by scotland decisions the referee from saturday france scotland six nations match has defended the officials handling of the game after criticism by matt williams the scotland coach said his side were robbed of victory by poor decisions made by the officials but nigel williams said satisfied the game was handled correctly meanwhile matt williams will not be punished by the scottish rugby union for allegedly using bad language in his comments about the officials he denies having done so nonetheless he was furious about several decisions that he felt denied his side famous victory but nigel williams told the scottish daily mail spoke to matt williams at the post match dinner he made no mention of the disallowed try or any other refereeing decisions whatsoever if matt has issues with the match officials then he is very welcome to phone me and discuss them ultimately there is match assessor at every international game to give an impartial and objective view of the performance of the officials that is the beginning and end of it fuming robinson blasts officials england coach andy robinson said he was livid after his side were denied two tries in sunday six nations loss to ireland in dublin mark cueto first half effort was ruled out for offside before the referee spurned tv replays when england crashed over in the dying minutes absolutely spitting livid there two tries we ve been cost robinson told bbc sport we ve got to go back to technology don know why we didn south african referee jonathan kaplan ruled that cueto was ahead of charlie hodgson when the fly half hoisted his cross field kick for the sale wing to gather kaplan then declined the chance to consult the fourth official when josh lewsey took the ball over the irish line under pile of bodies for what could have been the game winning try think mark cueto scored perfectly legal try and think he should have gone to the video referee on josh lewsey said robinson it is how we use the technology it is there and it should be used am still trying to work out the cueto try have looked at both and they both looked tries we are very disappointed and this will hurt there is no doubt about that we are upset now but the referee is in charge and he has called it his way and we have got to be able to cope with that we did everything we could have done to win the game am very proud of my players and with couple of decisions this could have been very famous victory thought we dominated matt stevens had an awesome game at tighthead prop while the likes of charlie hodgson martin corry and lewis moody all came through well josh lewsey was awesome and every one of the forwards stood up out there given the pressure we were under credit must go to all the players we have done everything but win game of rugby but ireland are good side they defended magnificently and they ve got every chance of winning this six nations england have lost their first three matches in this year six nations and four out of their six games since robinson took over from sir clive woodward in september owen determined to stay in madrid england forward michael owen has told the bbc he is happy in spain and has no plans to quit real madrid to return to the premiership in the near future but the year old who has spent much of his time coming off the bench in la liga did not rule out return to the premiership at some stage pleased with the start ve made here he told bbc radio five live england is my country it definitely part of me but who knows whether if or when ll be playing there again owen who moved to the bernabeu from liverpool last summer has grabbed goals for real but has been unable to replace raul or ronaldo in the starting line up however he said he was delighted with the way his time in spain was going and dismissed criticism of his decision to join real when first came there was lot of scepticism back in england any maybe some out here he said people were saying fourth choice striker what are you going there for you ll be sat on the bench all the time but as much as our press like to build it up as if ve permanently had my backside on the bench ve played as many games as anyone else in the team this year for fourth choice striker at the start more than happy with the way ve settled in recent speculation has linked owen with move back to england with newcastle expressing their interest but the england striker said he is not ready to return home he added ve got nothing against the premiership mean that where first performed that where made my name can keep my eyes off the premiership on television when at home when asked if it would have to be liverpool if he returned owen said ve not really given it much thought ve got great memories of liverpool no matter what happens it ll always be club have fond memories of and it will always have place in my heart it very flattering to be linked to top clubs in england glad that no one is forgetting me but couldn have wished for better start in madrid listen to the full interview with

association the year old has admitted two charges of improper conduct following his dismissal against arsenal the first charge relates to his failure to leave the field promptly pushing referee alan wiley and remonstrating with assistant referee paul norman and the second charge is for using threatening words and or behaviour to match official during the draw paolo di canio was given seven match suspension when he pushed referee paul alcock over in premiership game between sheffield wednesday and arsenal in prutton will be joined at wednesday hearing by saints boss harry redknapp who believes that the fa will throw the book at his player redknapp himself sprinted along the touchline to help physio jim joyce and coach denis rofe shepherd the enraged prutton away from referee assistant norman david has made big mistake and he knows it can condone what he done he was out of order but he knows that said redknapp he decent lad he over reacted badly for some reason he had rush of blood from somewhere off the pitch you couldn meet nicer lad prutton has apologised publicly for his actions and to arsenal robert pires who was injured in wild tackle by the saints midfield man he said it an horrendous situation apologise to the ref and linesman who were only doing their job ve also seen what happened to pires leg and sorry for that as well apologise for the people who saw it know you get lots of kids going to the match now and they don pay money to see that sort of thing it not cop out but it was all bit of blur sometimes you react and it beyond your control added prutton double injury blow strikes wales wales centre sonny parker and number eight ryan jones will miss saturday game with italy because of injury parker has not recovered from trapped nerve in his neck that kept him out of the win over england and tom shanklin is expected to continue at centre jones damaged his collar bone after coming on as replacement against england and joins flanker colin charvis foot injury on the sidelines meanwhile mike ruddock may make gavin henson his first choice kicker in rome the centre was wales hero in the six nations win over england landing huge late penalty from wide out to clinch the game first choice kicker stephen jones handed over responsibility because of henson greater kicking range but the fly half had already missed number of shots at goal our first aim was to get gavin settled into the team but giving him the kicks is something we ll talk about in selection this week wales coach mike ruddock told bbc sport wales henson himself says he is relishing all the media hype that has been heaped on him since last saturday game thrive on it and think it makes me perform better he said glad it short week before the italy game there was so much build up

babayaro when the transfer window reopens souness is bidding to bolster his defence and according to reports contract negotiations are at an advanced stage with the player babayaro has been in the premiership since when he moved to chelsea for from anderlecht but the year old has been surplus to requirements this season souness would not be drawn on specifics over individual players but he said all can tell you is that the chairman has worked really hard in the last couple of months to try to do deals we have said from day one we want to strengthen and that is what we are hoping to do in the coming weeks collins calls for chambers return world champion kim collins says suspended sprinter dwain chambers should be allowed to compete in the olympics again chambers was banned for two years after testing positive for the anabolic steroid thg and his suspension runs out in november this year but collins says the british olympic association should reverse the decision to ban him from the olympics for life it was too harsh collins told radio five live they should reconsider chambers has been in america learning american football but has not ruled out return to the track collins added he is great guy and have never had any problems with him we are friends would like to see dwain come back and compete again he is good person even though he made mistake he understands what he did and should be given chance once more rangers seal old firm win goals from gregory vignal and nacho novo gave rangers scrappy victory at celtic park that moves them three points clear of the champions rangers had rarely threatened until celtic goalkeeper rab douglas let defender vignal yard drive slip through his grasp and into the net opposite number ronald waterreus had been rangers hero saving superbly from craig bellamy and john hartson striker novo secured victory lobbing douglas with eight minutes remaining it ended celtic game unbeaten run at home in old firm derbies and gave rangers manager alex mcleish his first victory at the home of his glasgow rivals celtic had won their last six meetings on their home pitch including twice already this season they started confidently with new signing bellamy on loan from newcastle united given his celtic debut up front with wales international colleague john hartson and chris sutton dropping into midfield it took bellamy just four minutes to threaten taking on marvin andrews before delivering low drive that was held by waterreus at the second attempt he had an even better chance after hartson dispossesed sotiris kyrgiakos and sent his strike partner clear with only the goalkeeper to beat but waterreus did well to beat away bellamy disappointing low drive from yards waterreus came to the rescue again when the ball fell to hartson just inside the box and the dutch goalkeeper made brave block it was an old firm return for barry ferguson as mcleish stuck by the side that thumped four goals past hibernian but rangers found celtic harder to break down and douglas was not threatened until minutes after the break dado prso turned inside neil lennon only for the celtic goalkeeper to beat away his powerful yard drive great

waiting on leary aston villa thomas hitzlsperger is waiting to learn the future of manager david leary before committing himself to new contract with the club leary has been in talks over new deal and he said had message from thomas agent asking me what the news was on myself he wants to find out before he goes into discussions over thomas the reason thomas is not speaking to the club is because the agent wants to see the outcome of what happens to me hitzlsperger current deal expires in the summer and he has been offered new deal by the midlands club the german international is understood to be keen to remain at villa despite interest in his native country from hamburg but he wants assurances that leary will also be committing himself long term because negotiations over new three and half year contract appear to have stalled leary wants his backroom staff assistant manager roy aitken and fitness coach steve mcgregor to also be given satisfactory deals which will tie them to villa until the summer of robinson ready for difficult task england coach andy robinson faces the first major test of his tenure as he tries to get back to winning ways after the six nations defeat by wales robinson is likely to make changes in the back row and centre after the loss as he contemplates sunday set to with france at twickenham lewis moody and martin corry could both return after missing the game with hamstring and shoulder problems and the midfield pairing of mathew tait and jamie noon is also under threat olly barkley immediately allowed england to generate better field position with his kicking game after replacing debutant tait just before the hour the bath fly half cum centre is likely to start against france with either tait or noon dropping out tait given little opportunity to shine in attack received praise from robinson afterwards even if the coach admitted cardiff was an unforgiving place for the teenage prodigy robinson now has tricky decision over whether to withdraw from the firing line after just one outing player he regards as central to england future tait himself at least outwardly appeared unaffected by the punishing treatment dished out to him by gavin henson in particular want more of that definitely he said hopefully can train hard this week and get selected for next week but we ll have to look at the video and wait and see we were playing on our own for lot of the first half so it was quite difficult thought we defended reasonably well but we ve just got to pick it up for france his newcastle team mate noon hardly covered himself in glory in his first major test he missed tackle on michael owen in the build up to wales try conceded penalty at the breakdown was turned over in another tackle and fumbled gavin henson cross kick into touch all inside the first quarter his contribution improved in the second half but england clearly need more of playmaker in the inside centre role up front the line out remains fallible despite superb performance from chris jones whose athleticism came to the fore after stepping into the side for moody it is more likely the leicester flanker will return on the open side for the more physical challenge posed by the french forwards with andy hazell likely to make way lock ben kay also justified his recall with an impressive all round display on his return to the side but elsewhere england positives were thin on the ground wenger steps up row arsene wenger has stepped up his feud with sir alex ferguson by claiming the manchester united manager is guilty of bringing football into disrepute the pair long running row was put back in the headlines on saturday when ferguson said his arsenal counterpart was disgrace wenger initially refused to bite back saying only will never answer any questions any more about this man but now he claims ferguson should be punished by the football association the latest twist in the ferguson wenger saga came on saturday when the united boss in an interview with the independent newspaper discussed the events after the game between the two sides in october united won that day at old trafford but the game was followed by now notorious food fight which saw ferguson clothes covered in soup and pizza the sides meet again at highbury on february in the tunnel wenger was criticising my players calling them cheats so told him to leave them alone and behave himself ferguson said on saturday he ran at me with hands raised saying what do you want to do about it to not apologise for the behaviour of the players to another manager is unthinkable it disgrace but don expect wenger to ever apologise he that type of person those allegations were put to wenger after saturday game at bolton which arsenal lost to slip points behind chelsea in the title race at first he said only ve always been consistent with that story and told you nothing happened if he has to talk he talks if he wants to make newspaper article he makes newspaper article he doesn interest me and doesn matter to me at all will never answer to any provocation from him any more he does what he likes in england anyway he can go abroad one day and see how it is but later on saturday according to the independent wenger spoke to smaller group of reporters and expanded on his reaction have no diplomatic relations with him the arsenal boss is quoted as saying what don understand is that he does what he wants and you the press are all at his feet the situation concerning the food fight has been judged and there is game going on in month the managers have responsibility to protect the game before the game but in england you are only punished for what you say after the game now the whole story starts again don go into that game we play football am football manager and love football above all no matter what people say reminded that ferguson called him disgrace wenger added don respond to anything in england you have good phrase it is bringing the game into disrepute but that is not only after game it is as well before game ferguson had also claimed that united chief executive david gill and arsenal vice chairman david dein had agreed at boardroom level not to discuss the incident in public but ferguson added in the ensuing weeks all you got was diatribe from arsenal about being kicked off the pitch and all that nonsense gill phoned dein three times to complain but nothing was done the return is on february and they will come out with another diatribe david gill and feel we should set the record straight because arsenal have not written to us to apologise and we would not let that happen here meanwhile the league managers association have offered to act as peacemakers in the hope of resolving the on going row during that stormy game in october united striker ruud van nistelrooy caught arsenal ashley cole with one particularly strong tackle wenger later accused van nistelrooy of cheating and was fined and severely reprimanded by the football association ferguson admitted on saturday that van nistelrooy tackle which earned the dutchman ban could have given cole serious injury but he believes arsenal were the main aggressors wenger is always complaining the match was not played in the right spirit he added they are the worst losers of all time they don know how to lose maybe it is just manchester united they don lose many games to other teams we tend to forget the worst disciplinary record of all time was arsenal up until last season in fairness it has improved and now they are seen as paragons of virtue but to wenger it never happens it is all some dream or nightmare brizzel to run aaa in sheffield ballymena sprinter paul brizzel will be among eight of ireland european indoor hopefuls competing in this weekend aaa championships us based alistair cragg and mark carroll are the only irish athletes selected so far for the europeans who will not run in sheffield brizzel will defend his

up over the past few years and think this is the year for ireland he told bbc sport there is great chance to win grand slam lot of things are in our favour with england and france at home ireland have finished runners up three times including last year since the old five nations became six in and not finished outside the top three in the past five years despite being without flanker keith gleeson coach eddie sullivan has not had to contend with the sort of casualty lists that have hit england and scotland in particular prior to the tournament for ireland to win it we need to stay relatively injury free and fortunately we are one of the few teams that have done that so far wood added it is going to be tough and we need to take all the luck and opportunities that come our way ireland last game of the tournament is against wales in cardiff fixture they have not lost since but despite their traditional hospitality when the irish are visiting wood believes wales might end their four match losing run against england in cardiff so many of the major england players have either retired in the last year or are injured that think it will be very hard for them down in cardiff wood added wales

start with the celtic league in october followed by the heineken cup in february and march and the six nations moved to april and may after nine week break the wru then proposes two month period of away and home international matches wru chairman david pickering said the structure would end problems of player availability for club and country he added we feel sure that spectator interest would respond to the impetus of high intensity rugby being played continuously rather than the fragmented timetable currently in operation equally we suspect that the sponsors would prefer the sustained interest in continuous tournament and hopefully the broadcasters would also enjoy increased exposure moving the six nations from its traditional february beginning should also ensure better weather conditions and stimulate greater interest in the games and generally provide increased skills and competition and attract greater spectator viewing pickering argued the plan will be put before the international rugby board next month where four other plans drawn up by independent consultants for global integrated season will also be discussed pickering added it very early days and there are number of caveats associated with it not least the revenue from the broadcasters which is extremely important we ve got good plan and one which should be judged on its merits curbishley delight for

year to remember for irish there used to be one subliminal moment during year in irish rugby that stood out more than most well at least there used to one now there is handful to look back with mixture of satisfaction and sorrow it has been quite year for the irish and not just with eddie sullivan triple crown winning international outfit either right down through the ranks irish rugby is creating waves and upsetting the more established teams in the game but most of the kudos will go to sullivan and his merry band of warriors who not only collected their first triple crown for years but also finished their autumn campaign with record for the second year in succession they also finished in the runners up spot in the rbs six nations but in the three games in november which included victory over tri nations champions and grand slam chasing south africa ireland finsihed the year on high the victory at lansdowne road was only their second victory over the boks after the initial success back in that success was revenge for the consecutive defeats in blomefontein and cape town in the summer those two reverses and the flop against france were the only dark patches in an otherwise excellent months but the big one of course was the defeat of world cup champions england on their precious twickenham turf the winning try was conceived in sullivan mind perfectly executed by the team and finished immaculately by girvan dempsey for me the try of the championship sullivan career is now in vertical take off mode it is no wonder that sir clive woodward has elevated the galway based coach to head the lions test side not only that but fair majority of the present ireland side will be wearing red next june in new zealand there can be no doubt that ireland representation will be the biggest ever albeit in proposed man squad in brian driscoll and paul connell ireland have now the two front runners for the captaincy gordon arcy whose career began as teenager back in finally arrived when he was named the six nations player of the tournament but it was not only the senior squad that brought kudos to ireland the youngsters strutted their stuff on the big stage as well the under squad confounded the doubters as they went all the way to the world cup final in scotland only to be beaten by powerful all black side in the decider the young irish boys had stated their intentions earlier in the season when they finished runners up to england in the six nations under tournament on the provincial front leinster for second year in succession blew it when the heineken cup looked good wager while ulster finished runners up in their very tight group for the second season in succession it was munster again flying the flag for the irish looking to reach their third final they went down to eventual winners wasps in what many beileve was the most competitive and thunderous game ever witnessed at lansdowne road how wasps recovered from that energy sapping duel and then go onto to defeat toulouse in the final was anybody guess ulster meanwhile just lost out to adding the inaugural celtic cup in winning the celtic league when they were pipped at the post by the scarlets in the final game ulster however took time to start the new season under new coach mark mccall the once famous ravenhill fortress was breached four times as ulster only manged five wins from their first outings in the celtic league leinster are again looking the most potent outfit going into but whether they can take that final step under declan kidney is another thing on the down side irish rugby was hit by number of tragedies teenage star john mccall died while playing for the ireland against new zealand in the under world cup game in durban that happened only days after he led royal armagh to their first ulster schools cup success since the death of former ireland coach and lions flanker mike doyle in car crash in northern ireland shocked the rugby fraternity larger than life character doyle had coached ireland to the triple crown in the last time that goal had been achieved before this season ulster rugby also suffered the sudden deaths of well known

at my career you will see that have left many big players out for long time ve done it with dennis bergkamp kanu everybody it because it goalkeeper that all it usual situation for me you put your best team out no matter who it is for me it was not big mistake at old trafford and wasn alarmed by what happened against birmingham either it nothing against lehmann think he great keeper as is almunia you can only play one of them these people are not robots they have good periods and less good periods just because lehmann doesn play for two or three weeks or longer or shorter it doesn mean ve lost faith in him but former arsenal keeper david seaman believes lehmann has been harshly treated seaman told the daily mail jens is fantastic keeper he deserves another chance he has made few mistakes but on form he deserves to be the first team choice with arsenal hit by injuries and suspension inexperienced midfield pair of mathieu flamini and cesc fabregas will line up against rosenborg but wenger is confident they will prove more than capable it puts lot of pressure on them but it good learning process said wenger not worried as they are both mentally strong and will put in the needed workrate the gunners go into the game boosted by the news that defender sol campbell is on the verge of signing new deal with the club and the year old whose current contract runs out in the summer has made it clear he is determined to achieve champions league success with arsenal campbell said it means lot to me to go through it everything we want to carry on in this competition that where the best teams in europe are to be in there playing against these guys and trying to win the trophy is the first thing in my mind meanwhile thierry henry believes he will be blamed if arsenal fail to qualify for the next stage of the champions league henry will captain the side in place of the suspended patrick vieira as the gunners seek the required victory over rosenborg and the striker said if we don win and we go out of the competition like it or not it going to be my fault that the way it is if the team don win know will be criticised no matter how play owen delighted with real display michael owen revelled in his return to the to the real madrid starting line up and inspired win over real betis on wednesday by scoring the first goal he said am happy could play game from the start again felt good all though the game and it is obvious that am happy to have scored another goal people have talked lot about my performances and think have had some months that were not so good and others that were very good owen starting his third successive la liga match converted low cross from santiago solari robert carlos made it at the break smashing home an indirect free kick midfielder edu reduced the deficit after half time but ivan helguera headed past keeper antonio doblas to seal victory for his team victory took real to within six points of leaders barcelona and owen is confident real can close the gap he added we had several chances against betis and think we can get back in touch with barcelona it is only six points between barcelona and us and that is nothing if we can beat them at the bernabeu on april then it will be just three owen has scored nine league goals one behind real top scorer ronaldo real had lost their previous two league games rovers reject third ferguson bid blackburn have rejected third bid from rangers for scotland captain barry ferguson bbc sport has learnt it is thought blackburn want for the midfielder but chief executive john williams has confirmed the club are still in dialogue with rangers the year old has already handed in transfer request at ewood park as he seeks return to ibrox but the clubs have been unable to reach agreement over fee for ferguson who moved to lancashire in for on thursday rangers said they would not be increasing their offer of blackburn have said all along that they want for the midfielder and williams has rejected proposals from rangers over player swap deal williams said we are in dialogue with glasgow rangers but we have no agreement the negotiations will have to be concluded by midnight on monday when the winter transfer window shuts williams conceded any deal for ferguson was looking unlikely before the close of the transfer window but rangers still had chance to seal the deal we have no comment to make other than we have not got an agreement with glasgow rangers he added the way things are looking think it is unlikely we are going to the ball is in their court but we have not got an offer that is acceptable at this moment it is understood that blackburn accepted offer for ferguson from everton at the weekend but the player is determined to return to scotland and rejected move to goodison park ferguson did not play in the fa cup win over colchester on saturday despite recovering from groin injury with rovers boss mark hughes claiming it had been an emotional and difficult time for the player rusedski angry over supplements greg rusedski has criticised the governing body of men tennis for not releasing contamination free supplements in time for the new season rusedski said tried to order some but didn receive any and haven got any yet you would think they would have been available in december as it can take two months for the body to respond this event comes in the hottest period of the year so you would hope the stuff would be available for it the british number two escaped possible ban last year when he persuaded tribunal that positive doping test was the result of contaminated atp supplements in response the atp struck deal with pharmaceutical company glaxosmithkline to provide contamination free drinks and nutritional bars for the men tour david higdon vice president of the atp admitted agree with greg would have loved to have had these things available as soon as possible but it lot of work to make sure they have gone through rigorous testing the reality is though that the first two weeks of the tour are spread far and wide and part of the distribution agreement we had with gsk has an education component we weren going to just drop these products out there without having talk with the players about understanding how to use them the first chance we will get to do that is at the players meeting on the saturday before the australian open and rusedski who takes on roger federer at the qatar open later on wednesday conceded that the imminent changes will be beneficial the good thing is that there is now guarantee so hopefully all this will never happen again said rusedski hopefully after the australian open we won have to discuss this any more butler strikes gold in spain britain kathy butler continued her impressive year with victory in sunday th cross internacional de venta de banos in spain the scot who led gb to world cross country bronze earlier this year moved away from the field with ines monteiro halfway into the km race she then shrugged off her portuguese rival to win in minutes seconds meanwhile briton karl keska battled bravely to finish seventh in the men km race in time of kenenisa bekele of ethiopia the reigning world long and short course champion was never troubled by any of the opposition winning leisurely in butler said of her success felt great throughout the race and hope this is good beginning for marvellous season for me elsewhere abebe dinkessa of ethiopia won the brussels iaaf cross country race on sunday completing the course in gelete burka then crowned great day for ethiopia by claiming victory in the women race henson stakes early lions claim the six nations may be glittering prize in itself but every player from the four home unions will also have one eye on possible trip to new zealand with the lions this summer the player who staked the biggest claim for place in the starting xv over the weekend was gavin henson he very confident you just had to listen to his interview afterwards he beamed with confidence but although there an element of arrogance it good arrogance he certainly showed some nice touches he once showed clean pair of heels to mathew tait when he got outside him his defence was very good and he made some great kicks out of hand and that without even mentioning his majestic match winning penalty but think we need to wait and see what happens because he needs to be put to the test he needs to come up against brian driscoll or big french midfield wales fly half stephen jones was another player who impressed me he gave good direction he was very confident and he was nice general for his side he showed he can control game with jonny wilkinson not playing at the moment due to inury the number shirt could be up for grabs and jones or maybe even henson could make the lions team at fly half jones stuck his hand up and he certainly looks better bet than charlie hodgson after saturday game some of the wales forwards surprised me because thought they would be out muscled in the tight five england prop julian white is capable player but when it comes down to selection gethin jenkins is now going to have the upper hand because he came out on top however still think white and phil vickery will be in the frame some english players did their cause no harm thought joe worsley had solid game and jason robinson and josh lewsey both did nothing wrong but it looked too soon for young mathew tait and think it will be while before we see him again despite being written off beforehand several scots caught my eye against france tom smith has been there and done it before but the likes of chris cusiter jason white and ally hogg all made their mark hogg made couple of good runs while white had pretty robust game his defence is right up there cusiter looked very lively and he could be very good option for lions coach sir clive woodward the star of ireland win over italy in rome looks like certainty to make the starting xv against new zealand brian driscoll is class act he ran some good lines against italy made the breaks and fed his outside backs although italy defended man on man which made it easy for him gordon arcy was unlucky to go off injured early on but think you could get henson arcy driscoll combination in the lions midfield paul connell just needs to add hard edge to his game and malcolm kelly keeps on going and seems to be putting his hand up while shane byrne seems to be lively character but they will be bit worried after the italian pack drove them off their own ball on sunday although used to play in italy and know how difficult it can be one player who didn impress me was wales scrum half dwayne peel he choked late on in the second half when wales were trailing they had good possession and he kicked the ball away wouldn want him as my lions scrum half after that kluft impressed by sotherton form olympic heptathlon champion carolina kluft was full of admiration for britain kelly sotherton as the pair prepared to clash in birmingham both will be in action on friday in the hurdles and long jump ahead of the european indoor championships later this month in madrid sotherton finished third behind the swede in athens and kluft said knew about her she great girl she looked very good early in the season and was competing really well kluft showed impressive early season form on tuesday in stockholm ge galan meeting winning the sprint hurdles the long jump and the sotherton has also displayed promise with new high jump personal best in sheffield at the combined norwich union european trials and aaa championships and second place in the long jump behind jade johnson henman to face saulnier test british number one tim henman will face france cyril saulnier in the first round of next week australian open greg rusedski the british number two is in the same quarter of the draw and could face andy roddick in the second round if he beats swede jonas bjorkman local favourite lleyton hewitt will meet france arnaud clement while defending champion and world number one roger federer faces fabrice santoro women top seed lindsay davenport drew spanish veteran conchita martinez henman came from two sets down to defeat saulnier in the first round of the french open last year so he knows he faces tough test in melbourne the seventh seed who has never gone beyond the quarter finals in the year first major and is lined up to meet roddick in the last eight is looking forward to the match he tough player on any surface he got lot of ability he said we had really tight one in paris that went my way so going to need to play well from the outset because he dangerous competitor switzerland federer seeded one is the hot favourite having won three of the four grand slam titles in he has beaten santoro in five of their seven previous encounters but is taking nothing for granted it tricky match federer said played him at the us open and won quite comfortably then but you never know if the rhythm is bit off he can keep you guessing and make it difficult the most important thing though is to get used to playing five set matches and winning them the year old could meet four time champion andre agassi in the quarter finals before meeting russian marat safin the player he beat in last year final eighth seeded american agassi is set to play qualifier in round one if he can shake off hip injury which ruled him out of the kooyong classic second seed andy roddick will open his campaign against irakli labadze of georgia the american could meet rusedski in the second round seventh seed henman in the quarter finals and hewitt in the last four hewitt is hoping to become the first australian man to win the event since mark edmondson in the year old has never been beyond round four in eight attempts at melbourne park but has at least secured the opposite half of the draw to federer who beat him in the australian open wimbledon and us open last year safin seeded four opens his campaign against qualifier with th seed tommy haas the player he beat in the semi finals in possible fourth round opponent in the women draw davenport could encounter eighth seeded venus williams in the quarter finals and third ranked anastasia myskina the french open champion in the semi finals bronchitis ruled davenport the australian open champion out

saw desperate defence from leicester as wasps turned down several penalties to go for the try they needed wasps pounded the line and penalty try looked likely before referee nigel williams controversially blew for full time fly half goode was the tigers hero kicking points in total while leicester overwhelming domination in the scrums ultimately told even their lack of discipline in

big opportunity for any player the year old contract expires in the summer but real want quick deal sivabaek added will be meeting real on wednesday there is serious interest but it is everton hands

everton when the transfer window closes at the end of january moyes said speak to tommy regularly and we know where we are at there been no contact we don want to lose him real madrid general manager arrigo sacchi is the driving force behind the move convincing vice president emilio butragueno and new coach wanderley luxemburgo that gravesen is the right man for the bernabeu everton must weigh up

four this season balco case trial date pushed back the trial date for the bay area laboratory cooperative balco steroid distribution case has been postponed us judge susan illston pushed back preliminary evidentiary hearing which was due to take place on wednesday until june no official trial date has been set but it is expected to begin in september balco founder victor conte along with james valente coach remy korchemny and trainer greg anderson are charged with distributing steroids to athletes anderson clients include barry bonds and several other baseball stars have been asked to appear before congressional inquiry into steroid use in the major leagues the balco defence team have already lost their appeal to have the case dismissed at pre trial hearing in san francisco but

not arrested at that point but federal agents did obtain statements from them the defence are expected to challenge the legality of those interviews and if ilston agrees she could could reject all the

performance enhancing drugs chelsea denied by james heroics brave defensive display led by keeper david james helped manchester city hold the leaders chelsea after quiet opening james denied damien duff jiri jarosik and mateja kezman while paul bosvelt cleared william gallas header off the line robbie fowler should have scored for the visitors but sent his header wide chelsea had most of the possession in the second half but james kept out frank lampard free kick and superbly tipped the same player volley wide city went into the game with the proud record of being the only domestic team to beat chelsea this season and there was little to alarm them in the first minutes as chelsea deprived of arjen robben and didier drogba through injury struggled to pose much of threat indeed it was the visitors who looked likelier to enliven drab opening played at lethargic pace shaun wright phillips watched by england boss sven goran eriksson showed his customary trickery to burst into the right of the area and deliver dangerous ball which was blocked by john terry but chelsea suddenly stepped up gear and created flurry of chances first duff got round ben thatcher and blasted in shot that james parried to kezman who turned the ball wide soon afterwards jarosik found space in the area to powerfully head lampard corner goalwards but james tipped the ball over chelsea were now looking more like premiership leaders and james kept out kezman fierce drive before bosvelt and james combined to clear gallas header from duff corner city broke swiftly up the field and the last chance of frenetic spell should have resulted in fowler celebrating his th premiership goal wright phillips raced down the left and crossed to fowler but city lone man up front left free by terry slip contrived to head wide when it seemed breakthrough was certain the second half started as quietly as the first although james was forced to divert cross from the lively duff away from eidur gudjohnsen path there was nasty moment for petr cech looking for ninth straight clean sheet in the league when series of ricochets saw fowler chase loose ball in the area and collide accidently with the czech republic stopper another quiet spell followed which duff interrupted with surging run that was halted illegally on the edge of the penalty area by bosvelt lampard stepped up to blast shot through the wall and james somehow blocked it with his legs another timely challenge this time from richard dunne in time added on prevented gudjohnsen from getting in shot there was still time for james to produce sensational save to tip lampard volley round the post cech paulo ferreira gallas terry bridge jarosik tiago lampard makelele duff gudjohnsen kezman cole subs not used johnson smertin cudicini

handed wales leading role ryan giggs will captain wales as he wins his th cap in wednesday friendly against hungary in cardiff john toshack in his first game as coach after succeeding mark hughes admits he is surprised that giggs has only just reached the landmark with the games he played for united proportionately it doesn seem that many for wales toshack said but he one of the greatest of all welsh internationals and on his th cap it appropriate he captain giggs admits he had briefly considered retirement from the international game but is now targetting playing for wales in the european championships the manchester united wing revealed how club manager sir alex ferguson talked him into extending his wales career briefly discussed my international future with sir alex but he urged me to carry on giggs said he feels like myself that have no weight problems and keep myself fit so in three or four years time will be able to play in the european finals if we get there the manager has always wanted me to play for my club and country and he was keen for me to continue because am fit enough giggs admits he was wavering and considering joining the likes of former wales skipper gary speed and united team mate paul scholes in committing the remaining years of his career to club football but giggs is now focussed on making the toshack era even more successful than the time hughes spent at the helm the manchester united winger won his first cap as year old in an away loss to germany and now faces his landmark appearance at the age of with giggs leading wales out against hungary there is every chance that he will become the permanent successor to speed however toshack refused to reveal whether he sees giggs as long term option for this particular game think it is appropriate that ryan giggs will be captain it his th cap and he known for some time about that toshack said on wednesday night toshack takes charge of his first match since replacing hughes and giggs said it my th cap and am looking forward to it and hope to play lot more times from here on in it important to be here all the players feel the same it new start and all the top players certainly see it as important see myself leading by example it is something have taken on for wales as well as united these past few seasons the way john is looking at things he is aiming to build his side around the experienced lads right up to the next tournament the euro event have told john will be around for the next european tournament by then will be so hopefully will still be okay lot can happen but hoping to be around giggs own personal future at old trafford is still up in the air as he has yet to reach agreement on new contract with manchester united offering one extra year and giggs seeking two have put the contract thing to the back of my mind at the moment said giggs it is an important period for the club and am just concentrated on that ve heard the suggestions hopefully there is two year deal about to be offered because that is what am looking for to get it sorted out enjoying my football the way united have been playing and my own form you have to enjoy it we have

saying that not fair tired of not saying anything we ve been practising hard we ve had serious injuries ve had surgery and after got to the wimbledon final don know many who have done that while serena is through to the australian open semi finals venus went out in the fourth round meaning she has not gone further than the last eight in her last five grand slam appearances but serena added venus had severe strain in her stomach actually had the same injury but didn tear it the way she did if would have torn it wouldn have been here she played player alicia molik that just played out of her mind and venus made some errors that she probably shouldn have made serena also said people tended to forget the impact the murder of sister yetunde price had had on the family to top it off we have very very very very very close family serena continued to be in some situation that we ve been placed in in the past little over year it not easy to come out and just perform at your best when

former world number one jimmy connors is planning long term relationship with the lawn tennis association to help unearth the next tim henman the american spent three days at the lta annual elite performance winter camp in la manga earlier this week britain has the right attitude said connors the more involved can be with the lta the better short term arrangement is just confusing the kids will ask what am doing there lta chief executive john crowther added the relationship that jimmy already started to develop with the coaches and the players has said to us that we like some more of it we want to use jimmy for number of weeks year and we hope this is the beginning of good long term relationship the camp played host to more than leading senior and junior players including greg rusedski arvind parmar and anne keothavong la manga is an amazing site to take bunch of kids who want to be the best said connors speaking at queen club in london what impressed me most was not only the coaches but the way the kids went about their workouts and the feeling they put into every practice they had it was interesting to me to see kids of with that desire and passion and that can only be brought about by the coaches surrounding them instilling the importance of work and practice is something you can buy they know what been given to them and all they have to do is give back the effort and every minute of practice they were doing that speaking from la manga lta performance director david felgate told bbc sport jimmy was fantastic with the players and the coaches and very humble considering what he achieved he worked through the coaches and hopefully it will grow and he ll get to have more of an individual relationship with some of the players and get to know them he made it clear from the word go he didn want it to be short term this is week year job for me it my life and my passion and it the same with the coaches he respects that but he wants to be involved and have real input and why would he stake his reputation on something that not going to be successful connors has also agreed to commentate for the bbc at next year wimbledon championships he will work

anders svensson and matt oakley are likely replacements with kevin phillips also scheduled to start with henri camara rested brentford boss martin allen after conceding eight goals in our last three matches have to admit not very confident there no doubt we re the underdogs and after defending so poorly recently it not looking good southampton have just drawn with the premiership champions and that makes our task harder than it was already southampton boss harry redknapp we know they can give us problems brentford have done well but we are the premiership side and should have the better players staying in the premiership is our priority we want to win of course we do we ll battle but if it comes to football match think we ll win key match stats brentford are the lowest ranked club left in the fa cup they re on their best run in the competition since reaching the quarter finals for the fourth time in their history years ago now they have the carrot of the plum draw in the last eight dangling before them victory over premiership strugglers southampton would bring the mighty manchester united to griffin park and gigantic pay day for the sole league one survivors martin allen brave side came back from two goals down at st mary to earn deserved replay southampton striker henri camara scored twice from close range to put the saints in command but isaiah rankin hit back just before half time and sam sodje headed past creaky defence on minutes the londoners have conceded six goals in their two subsequent league outings three each in losing away to hartlepool and drawing at home to sheffield wednesday but they haven lost in six league and cup games on home turf winning three and drawing three since the reverse to torquay on boxing day southampton go into this tie on the back of an eventful premiership match with arsenal on saturday an angry david prutton pushed referee alan wiley after being shown the red card but his side still came back to draw it was saints fourth stalemate in succession in all competitions but didn lift them out of the relegation zone the retention of their ever present premier league status must be the number one priority irrespective of the rewards that success against brentford would bring victory here would set up repeat of the final when saints astounded the football world by defeating tommy docherty manchester united courtesy of bobby stokes famous winner they also knocked out the red devils in on penalties in the fourth round but to write another chapter in their fa cup history the solent side must avoid succumbing to lower

fulham were then in the second division when they won third round replay at craven cottage on january to get to within two matches of second visit to the millennium stadium in three years for the

ruling him out of the first part of the championship we will seek further specialist advice in due course to determine just how long scott may be out for another potential option glasgow flanker andrew wilson has been ruled out for month after damaging ligaments in both knees against northampton recently flanker jason white and prop tom smith have also been suffering from flu and missed this week training sessions we have got plenty of good young players coming through and we have got to look at the opportunities it represents for them rather than the negatives williams added williams could now turn to edinburgh pair alasdair strokosch and simon cross leeds tykes flanker jon dunbar also trained with the squad but is still awaiting verification of his eligibility to qualify for scotland wales win in rome wales secured their first away win in the rbs six nations for nearly four years with six try victory in rome tries from jonathan thomas tom shanklin and martyn williams gave the visitors half time advantage luciano orquera did reply with one for italy but second half efforts from brent cockbain shane williams and robert sidoli sealed victory fly half stephen jones added four conversions as wales maintained their superb start to this year tournament starting full of confidence after their victory over england the visitors scored the opening try after just four minutes diminutive wing shane williams fielded kick ahead and danced past the onrushing andrea masi and aaron persico into the italian half his pass to tom shanklin appeared forward but when the centre was held up short the ball was switched left and michael owen long cut out pass gave the lurking thomas an easy run in stephen jones who retained the kicking duties despite gavin henson heroics against england slotted an excellent conversion from wide out wales twice threatened further scores but failed to find the crucial pass and italy hit back out of the blue in the th minute henson sporting gold boots rather than the silver variety that did for england beat two players with ease out on the left touchline but his attempted chip ahead was charged down by orquera who snaffled the loose ball and hared away from halfway to score in the right corner with the welsh line out stuttering and italy twice turning the visitors scrum the home side forward power brought them back into it but clever high kick from henson almost brought try for hal luscombe when roland de marigny and ludovico nitoglia made hash of claiming it as the ball bounced into touch wales regained control with second try in the st minute henson lobbing up high kick to the left corner where shanklin jumped higher than nitoglia to dot down his th test try jones was unable to convert and de marigny then hit the upright with penalty attempt for italy henson was also narrowly short with long range effort at goal but wales ended the half with vital third score to give themselves some breathing space henson sent luscombe streaking away and when he off loaded to martyn williams the flanker showed his nous to ground the ball against the padding of the post jones adding the conversion italy who lost flanker mauro bergamasco with head knock before half time built up head of steam on the resumption de marigny landed penalty to make it and nitoglia break through the middle threatened try only for the move to break down with knock on but wales put the outcome beyond doubt with two superb tries in four minutes before the hour their fourth after minutes was sparked by another mazy run from shane williams who beat several players with ease and finished with powerful angled run from lock cockbain before italy could recover from that blow strong surge from gareth thomas and great off loads from martyn williams and replacement kevin morgan saw shane williams scamper over with jones converting both for lead wales had the luxury of sending on five more replacements for the final quarter the icing on the cake came with sixth try after more superb support work shane williams and ceri sweeney combining to send sidoli over in the left corner the only downside for wales was hamstring injury suffered by luscombe but after back to back wins at the start of the tournament for the first time in years they will travel to paris in fortnight looking like genuine contenders de marigny mirco bergamasco

mutu hope arsenal boss arsene wenger would consider signing adrian mutu once the striker has served his drugs ban mutu was sacked by chelsea on friday after testing positive for cocaine move wenger has backed but he said don even wonder if that could happen because think he will be suspended for long period but once he has served his suspension he has the right again to start from zero would then meet the player and see what he tells me mutu faces ban of between six months and two years when the football association decides on his punishment chelsea decided to act before his case was heard and sacked the striker on grounds of gross misconduct after it was revealed that he had failed drug test but mutu has hit out at the club decision saying chelsea have destroyed me he told the sunday mirror don know what going to do am shocked and surprised by their decision didn expect them to pay me while was suspended but never thought they would sack me either why didn they wait to do this now my career is in ruins might as well walk away from football what is there left for me chelsea have been criticised for their stance with the professional footballers association accusing the club of failing in their duty of care to the player and mutu agreed adding it is unfair if they were going to sack me they should have done it afterwards why did they go public to make an example of me it makes it very difficult for me now benitez issues warning to gerrard liverpool manager rafael benitez has ordered captain steven gerrard not to play down their champions league ambitions and be

interested in the year old but that he would prefer to stay where he is davies one of the stars of saturday rbs six nations win over england is only on year contract at kingsholm but the hooker has proved his worth to the zurich premiership side and is likely to get new deal next season the summer demise of the celtic warriors region left davies in the cold and forced him to take semi professional contract with neath rfc although he got match time with the ospreys at the request of the wales management he admitted before his move to gloucester that he was angry with the way he was treated the wru didn give me any help off the field it was very disappointing davies said at the time it was hard time throughout the summer then deciding whether to accept an offer from stade

year old nadal and moya winning both friday singles rubbers american twins mike and bob bryan gave the visitors hope with victory over juan carlos ferrero and tommy robredo in saturday doubles but it remained an uphill task for us team far happier on hard courts than clay and french open champion moya had too much for world number two roddick this has been incredible the moment ve been waiting for for years said moya who missed out in through injury ve prepared myself for this day knew that playing on clay would have my chances to win the davis cup is my dream can ask for more there is nothing bigger than what ve lived today moya stormed into lead on his way to taking the first set against roddick and recovered immediately from dropping serve in the second the match came down to two tie breaks and moya dominated both clinching victory on his third match point wild celebrations followed with an emotional moya congratulated by his team mates including nadal who at years and days becomes the youngest ever victor in davis cup history think we put up better fight here than in paris two years ago said roddick who was on the us team which lost to france in the semi finals at roland garros they were just better than us this weekend have nothing to be ashamed of gave it my all am not going to walk out of here with my head down that for sure there no miracle answer we have to improve ferguson fears milan cutting edge manchester united manager sir alex ferguson said his side task against ac milan would not be made any easier by the absence of andriy shevchenko milan talismanic european footballer of the year misses wednesday champions league first leg tie after fracturing his cheekbone it loss to milan but it could be worse if they didn have such quality to bring in ferguson said how much they miss him think they ll know tomorrow night ferguson said milan front line would still represent formidable challenge for his defenders they can play rui costa and play kaka forward they can bring serginho in and they can play jon dahl tomasson he said ferguson own goalscoring talisman ruud van nistelrooy is fit again but the scot admitted he was unsure whether to start the dutchman who has not played for three months ruud is the best striker in europe what have to judge is whether he will struggle with the early pace after being out for so long he said his ability puts him in with big shout but it is major decision ferguson though is confident his young players particularly wayne rooney and cristiano ronaldo are up to the task we have an opportunity to win this cup this year no question about that he declared with the maturity we see every week in ronaldo and rooney the return of van nistelrooy and the form of roy keane paul scholes and ryan giggs we must have fantastic chance it is view shared by rooney who believes if we can get past milan we have great chance as soon as knew we were playing milan got excited looking at the draw it is anyone trophy but we have every chance hopefully we can get to that final in turkey and bring the cup back to manchester milan coach carlo ancelotti said his team were looking forward to returning to the venue where they lifted europe most prestigious club title two seasons ago milan beat juventus in penalty shootout after tie at old trafford and ancelotti said we are all very happy to return to old trafford to play in the champions league and this will give us great motivation ancelotti said he was aware of the threat united posed to his hopes of champions league glory it fundamental that we don allow them to take control of the game our intention is not to adapt to their play but to play our game he said they have great quality in attack they use the wings lot and we will have to make sure we stop them clijsters could play aussie open kim clijsters has denied reports that she has pulled out of january australian open because of her persistent wrist injury open chief paul mcnamee had said kim wrist obviously isn going to be rehabilitated but her spokesman insisted she had simply delayed submitting her entry the doctors are assessing her injury on weekly basis and if there is no risk she could play but if there the least risk she will stay away despite being absent from the wta entry list for the tournament which begins on january clijsters would be certain to get wild card if she requested one clijsters is still ranked nd in the world despite only playing handful of matches last season the belgian had an operation on her left wrist early in the season but injured it again on her return to the tour meanwhile jelena dokic who used to compete for australia has opted out of the first grand slam of the season dokic has not played in the australian open since when she lost in the first round but the year old would have had to rely on wild card next season because her ranking has tumbled to th four time champion monica seles who has not played since last year french

in their friendly win over croatia robbie keane took his republic record to with first half goal which proved enough for victory we had more good chances it is just shame we did not take them against such technically gifted team said kerr but given the conditions and the standard of the croatian team we should be very happy with the win the republic side kept clean sheet for the eighth time in matches and are unbeaten in home games since kerr succeeded mick mccarthy kerr applauded the decisive move which earned the victory it was brilliant goal fantastic skill by damien duff robbie might have scuffed it little but it was good goal matchwinner keane was another full of praise for duff role in the goal it was great play from damien said the tottenham striker always try to be sniffing around because you know nine times out of duffer is going to get it in the box playing three up was something different brian kerr wanted to try it out and it was good to see young stephen elliott getting run out the conditions were difficult but he did well and is definitely one for the future it is nice to see young players coming through man of the match duff explained what went wrong when he fluffed chance to make it midway through the second half he opted to bring steve finnan cross down and shoot against the bar when close range header looked the best option would have headed that every time but completely lost it in the lights said the chelsea star was desperate to get on the scoresheet myself but the result is the important thing we have had good year and are going nicely in the qualifiers hopefully that can continue in juninho demand for neill talks juninho agent has confirmed that the player is hoping for talks with martin neill as the brazilian midfielder comes closer to departing celtic brian hassell says no official approach has been received from manchester city but that the english club had been earmarked as possible destination but it was being stressed to bbc sport that juninho would prefer to remain with the scottish champions juninho wants assurances that he will return to neill first team plans he has become frustrated with his lack of first team action since his move from middlesbrough in the summer hassel says juninho who has just bought new home would desperately like to stay at celtic but will seek move if it is made clear that he is not wanted the agent also stressed that nothing should be read into the year old father being in scotland and talk of move back to botafogo in brazil juninho father was simply in the country to see his son and grandchildren know there is interest from brazilian club but know juninho doesn want to go there said hassel he wants to stay in britain in fact he wants to stay at celtic hassall made it clear that move to manchester city who are badly in need of midfield play maker was more of possibility than botafogo or mexican outfit red sharks veracruz who also expressed an interest it was thought at one stage he said if you are not going to get game under one manager you look for another whose style of play suits you he is fan of kevin keegan style of play it would not be bad move for him juninho had earlier told the daily record the manager has had lot of chances to put me in his team but it hasn happened if that is the case then this is the opportunity for me to go that would be good for the club and good for me if have no part in his plans there is no point in remaining here waiting for chance that never comes the attacking midfielder also claims he has not had the backing of boss martin neill since his move to celtic park can understand why am in this situation he continued when manager brings new player to the club he gives that player support gebrselassie in london triple bid double olympic champion haile gebrselassie will race in the london marathon for the next three years the ethiopian legend won sunday almeria half marathon in spain on his return from an operation on his achilles tendon he was third in london in in his first serious attempt at the marathon it is coup for us to secure haile presence for the next three years and it guarantees quality race said race director david bedford gebrselassie will face olympic champion stefano baldini world champion jaouad gharib and arch rival paul tergat the current world record holder if didn think could win would not be here said gebrselassie who has set world records on occasions in his illustrious career and is keen to add the marathon record to his collection there are lot of fantastic runners in the race but shall be doing my utmost to upset them white prepared for battle tough scrummaging prop julian white is expecting resurgent wales to give him rough ride in england six nations opener in cardiff on saturday the leicester tight head is in the form of his life making the england number three shirt his own but he knows wales will put his technique under immense scrutiny the welsh scrum is force to be reckoned with he told bbc sport they have made lot of changes for the better over the last few years white is also impressed with the welsh pack strength in depth gethin jenkins is starting at loose head for them he has played bit at tight head but think his favoured position is loose head and he is very good he added the year old has made massive contribution to the england and leicester cause of late and is arguably the form tight head prop in the world he destroyed south africa os du randt in the scrum at twickenham last autumn to give england the platform for an impressive victory leicester who signed white from bristol when the west country side were relegated from the zurich premiership in the summer of have also been aided by white presence this season the tigers are sitting pretty at the top of the premiership table and have also booked their place in the last eight of the heineken cup am pleased with my form he said but my form is helped by the people play with at leicester people like martin johnson and graham rowntree it been good season so far and to be in the starting xv for the first game of the six nations is what every player wants am delighted with the way things have gone but we have to get it right this weekend white is now one of the more experienced members of the england squad which takes to the field on saturday injuries have taken their toll and coach andy robinson has been deprived of richard hill jonny wilkinson martin corry mike tindall will greenwood and stuart abbott and with caps and world cup winner medal to his name white is now in position to offer his experience to youngsters such as centres matthew tait and jamie noon don know how much experience tight head can give centre but you are there to give them pat on the back if things go wrong or to be there if they want to talk in any way he added when first came into the squad people like jason leonard and martin johnson were the first to come over and talk through things and help out it gives you lot of confidence when people like that speak to you was in awe of lot of them so to sit down and speak with them and realise you are on the same wavelength is good white missed the vast majority of last year six nations because of knee injury and is raring for the event to get going and that is despite the opening game taking place amid the red hot atmosphere in cardiff enjoy the atmosphere the millennium stadium is probably one of the best stadiums in the world he said to go down there and hear the shouting and the singing it one of my favourite places to play this is probably the most even six nations for long time england ireland france and wales are all contenders on form ireland should be favourites but you just don know that the great thing about this tournament england to launch ref protest england will protest to the international rugby board irb about the referee performance in the defeat by ireland reports the daily mail england coach andy robinson has called on ex international referees colin high and steve lander to analyse several of jonathan kaplan decisions want to go through the tape with colin and steve robinson told the daily mail want to speak to the irb about it think only one side was refereed high the rugby football union referees manager claimed kaplan made three major errors which changed the outcome of sunday match england were beaten by the irish in dublin their third straight defeat in the six nations the international rugby board will be disappointed high told the daily mail jonathan kaplan is in the top in the world but that wasn an international performance it would not have been acceptable in the zurich premiership if one of my referees had done that would have had my backside kicked for making the appointment if any english referee refereed like that in european match there would be an inquest no question about that if someone had performed like that he would have been pulled from the next game

qualified for the knockout stages alongside partizan and villareal at the expense of lazio but boss mcclaren is looking for victory which would mean they avoid team that has played in the champions league in friday third round draw to need win to finish top is fantastic but it is going to be tough one mcclaren said when the draw was made thought it was the toughest group of them all and so it has proved lazio were favourites villarreal have been semi finalists and partizan have fantastic experience in europe the pleasing thing is we did the business in the first two games winning those two has put us in great position and it has been fantastic experience playing these teams jones files conte lawsuit marion jones has filed lawsuit for defamation against balco boss victor conte following his allegations that he gave her performance enhancing drugs the sydney olympic gold medallist says conte damaged her reputation and she is seeking in the suit conte whose company is at the centre of doping investigation made the claims in us television programme he and three others were indicted in february by federal grand jury for variety of alleged offences in an email to the associated press on wednesday conte said stand by everything said jones won three gold medals and two bronzes in sydney in her lawsuit filed in the us district court in san francisco said the sprinter had passed lie detector test and that she has never taken banned performance enhancing drugs conte statements the suit added were false and malicious after the abc television program earlier this month jones lawyer richard nicholls said marion has steadfastly maintained her position throughout she has never ever used performance enhancing drugs victor conte is man facing count federal indictment while marion jones is one of america most decorated female athletes mr conte statements have been wildly contradictory mr conte chose to make unsubstantiated allegations on television while marion jones demanded to take and then passed lie detector examination mr conte is simply not credible we challenge him to submit to the same lie detector procedure that marion jones passed the sport ruling body the iaaf is taking cautious approach to conte allegations but contacted the us anti doping agency communications director nick davies said the iaaf would seek to contact conte for further information but davies stressed it would be up to the american authorities to decide whether they will take action against jones in light of conte television interview and the world governing body would monitor the situation closely if it is felt there is case to answer it would be for its national governing body usa track and field to take the appropriate disciplinary action he added the us anti doping agency has proved itself to be very diligent in its anti doping war and am sure like ourselves they will be watching the television programme with great interest jones who is under investigation for steroid use by the us anti doping agency has continually denied ever taking illegal substances since being investigated in the balco scandal although she praised zinc supplement conte marketed jones who did not win any medals in athens in august has never failed drugs test meanwhile conte who has been charged along with three other men of distributing illegal steroids and money laundering is due to face trial in march premier league planning cole date the premier league is attempting to find mutually convenient date to investigate allegations chelsea made an illegal approach for ashley cole both chelsea and arsenal will be asked to give evidence to premier league commission but no deadline has been put on when that meeting will convene it hard to put date on it premier league spokesman confirmed to bbc sport it not formal situation where they ve got so much time to respond arsenal and england defender cole reportedly met blues boss jose mourinho and chief executive peter kenyon in london hotel days ago chelsea have yet to officially confirm or deny the meeting which would be in breach of premier league rule now the gunners have asked for an inquiry to look into claims that their player has been tapped up both clubs have pledged to co operate with the inquiry which will be conducted on single day as opposed to being run as an ongoing evaluation cole is in negotiations with the gunners over extending his current deal which ends in and his arsenal team mate robert pires has urged the england left back to stay at highbury pires told the evening standard he has been at arsenal for ever he is very attacking left back and think he is enjoying his football because at arsenal he plays in an offensive team am not sure he will get the same pleasure at chelsea even though they are doing so well at the moment have built fantastic playing relationship with ashley we play together so well we could do it with our eyes shut but you have to respect the decision of the player everybody has that right williams stays on despite dispute matt williams insists he has no thoughts of quitting as national coach as result of the power struggle currently gripping scottish rugby the chairman chief executive and three non executive directors all departed in row over the game future direction but williams said want to make it clear that committed totally to scottish rugby ve brought my family here and we ve immersed ourselves in scottish life there no way that walking away however he attempted to steer clear of taking sides in the dispute like to stress that the national team is separate to the political situation he said when you come to an undertaking like this and you are trying to make difference then there are always people who will begrudge you who are jealous and want to try to drag you down when you have that situation you have to have the courage of your convictions to see it through there was some very unhelpful and uninformed comment that the national team had received massive increase in budget at the expense of other parts of scottish rugby and that is simply not the case like all good coaches you go and ask for an increase but we were told in no uncertain terms that the financial situation did not allow that the idea that we are lighting cigars with notes while the rest of scottish rugby flounders is absolutely untrue we also attracted criticism because of the number of days players spent with the national team but let me give you the truth our irish counterparts whom we have to compete with in few days time had days together at the summer they are currently in camp now and they will have another days in camp before the six nations that means they will have days away from their club from july until the six nations we on the other hand will have there must be win win philosophy and attitude within scottish rugby and that is what we are after both groups winning not competing israeli club look to africa four african players

metatarsal bones in his foot and will be out for at least six weeks robben had an mri scan on the injury sustained during the premiership win at blackburn on monday six weeks is the average time to heal this injury and then need few more weeks to be completely fit again he told dutch newspaper algemeen dagblad had feeling it was serious but because of the swelling it was impossible to make final diagnosis the year old missed the first three months of the season with similar injury after challenge with roma olivier dacourt and he added it felt different then last summer when had the same injury on my other foot then could walk already after three days but stayed sidelined for long period hope that it will now take me six to eight weeks chelsea physio mike banks was hopeful that robben could return at some point in march the fractures are tiny and he could be playing next month banks told the club website one is chip on the side of his foot the other is small break on the third metatarsal but this is not the traditional metatarsal that has become so famous since the last world cup and which has kept scott parker out for two months david beckham suffered broken metatarsal in

with steve gerrard to reject any overtures from chelsea the ex reds assistant boss also warned that any honours won at chelsea would be cheapened by the bid to buy success he told bbc radio five live liverpool would think about any bid made but it will all be down to steve in the end but it wouldn have that same sweet feeling at chelsea where it all money orientated and about simply buying the best thompson reacted sharply to some liverpool supporters who criticised gerrard performance in the carling cup final against chelsea number of fans questioned gerrard commitment and sarcastically branded his own goal in liverpool defeat as his first goal for chelsea thompson added heard those comments from so called supporters and they were diabolical absolutely outrageous stevie carried the club last year and this year he always put liverpool first thompson who savoured seven title winning seasons and two european cup triumphs during his anfield playing career is confident that the lure of champions league football will keep gerrard at anfield hope champions league football will beckon for liverpool either as winners or as finishing fourth in the premiership and he will commit himself there has been lot of soul searching the way things have gone lately hope he hardening to the fact he will have big decisions to make but hope it is to the benefit of steven gerrard and hope

zealand this summer chelsea ridiculed over complaint barcelona assistant coach henk ten cate has branded chelsea expected complaint to uefa as pathetic the blues are poised to complain about an alleged half time incident during wednesday loss at the nou camp the source of chelsea anger was an alleged talk between barca boss frank rijkaard and referee anders frisk who later dismissed didier drogba to react the way chelsea have is pathetic mourinho lied with the line ups and now this ten cate said uefa has said its own tunnel representative witnessed nothing unusual out of the ordinary during the half time break spokesman william gaillard said frisk says rijkaard greeted him and apologised he had not had the opportunity to say hello before the game we had two uefa officials there and neither witnessed it the referee dressing room was locked and he and his assistants were the only people allowed in indeed it is the londoners who could be on the receiving end of any punishment after failing to turn up for the compulsory press conference after the defeat uefa delegate thomas giordano added the only unusual thing that happened as far as we are concerned is that chelsea failed to present themselves in the press conference the referee is not expected to include any of the alleged incidents in his report to uefa weakening chelsea case rijkaard was critical of mourinho decision not to speak to the media after the match there was lot of talking before the game and now surprisingly there is lot of talking after the game it is not good behaviour after match he said maybe they want to start something and make it worse than than it is really don understand it am very calm about it barca midfielder deco formerly managed by mourinho at porto agreed that it was not typical of his fellow portuguese to lodge protest it not normal behaviour on his part it was not logical he did not give news conference he said rijkaard added chelsea is the team which has conceded fewest goals in the english league and they defend very well so am very pleased with the win my men deserved victory and am pleased to have won this match congratulate my players moya suffers shock loss fifth seed carlos moya was the first big name to fall at the australian open as he went down to fellow spaniard guillermo garcia lopez on monday moya began the year with victory at the chennai

struggling with hip injury earlier in the week stormed to win agassi will play france olivier patience or germany rainer schuettler the man he beat in the final in the next round no one was more concerned about the injury than myself said eighth seed agassi worked hard to be down here and ready but the last few days ve pushed through the injury and it seemed to do pretty good in other matches world junior champion gael monfils made use of his wild card with magnificent win over american robby ginepri the champion thomas johansson fought back to beat peter luczak and french open champion gaston gaudio beat justin gimelstob seeds dominik hrbaty ivan ljubicic and mario ancic made comfortable progress but former french open champion albert costa lost to bjorn phau ronaldo considering new

hardcourt event in adelaide with crushing win over argentine juan ignacio chela dent will meet swede joachim johansson on sunday after the second seed survived tense tie break to defeat belgium olivier rochus johansson the boyfriend of lleyton hewitt sister jaslyn received strong crowd support on saturday it feels like home for me because jaslyn lives here said johansson rochus was leading in the second set tiebreak but his concentration was ruffled by disputed line call and the match slipped away it was so close one mistake like this and the match is over it tough for me it was clearly out rochus said smith aims to bring back respect scotland manager walter smith says he wants to restore the national team respectability in world football smith has joined his first squad for three day get together near manchester in preference to playing friendly while qualification for the world cup appears to be beyond scotland smith is anxious that the remainder of the campaign should be positive think we have got to try to get bit of respectability back in whatever way we can he said we will have to approach each game differently obviously we will have to approach the italian game away from home in different manner to moldova at home we have to meet the challenge of each match smith meeting number of his squad for the first time brought them together on monday to outline his ideas for improving the nation fortunes he said pointed out how see the international team going forward and that was the main topic this is relaxed gathering and don think there is lot of doom and gloom about the squad that lot of people think exists man squad will spend the next three days based at the mottram hall hotel in cheshire and will train at manchester united nearby carrington complex smith will be absent for the final sessions however as he is due to fly out to sardinia on wednesday to watch italy friendly with russia federer claims dubai crown world number one roger federer added the dubai championship trophy to his long list of successes but not before he was given test by ivan ljubicic top seed federer looked to be on course for easy victory when he thumped the eighth seed in the first set but ljubicic who beat tim henman in the last eight dug deep to secure the second set after tense tiebreak swiss star federer was not about to lose his cool though turning on the style to win the deciding set the match was re run of last week final at the world indoor tournament in rotterdam where federer triumphed but not until ljubicic had stretched him for five sets really wanted to get off to good start this time and did and could really play with confidence while he still looking for his rhythm federer said that took me all the way through to on his serve and almost ran away with it but he came back and that was good effort on his side ljubicic was at loss to explain his poor showing in the first set didn start badly but then suddenly felt like my racket was loose and the balls were flying little bit too much and with roger if you relax for second it just goes very quick he said after those first three games it was no match at all don know it was really weird was playing really well the whole year and then suddenly found myself in trouble just to put the ball in the court but despite his defeat the world number was pleased with his overall performance had chance in the third and for me it really positive to twice in two weeks have chance against roger to win the match it an absolutely great boost to my confidence that up there and belong with top class players iranian misses israel match iranian striker vahid hashemian will not travel to israel for bayern munich champions league match against maccabi tel aviv on wednesday the german club said the player had pulled out because of back injury iran refuses to recognise israel right to exist and does not allow its citizens to travel to the country bayern spokesman said on monday that the decision not to take hashemian to israel had been motivated only by his physical condition he got back pain and he couldn train the spokesman said it would have made no sense for him to go iran gave judo world champion arash miresmaeili reward when he refused to fight an israeli at the athens olympics the international judo federation considered taking action against miresmaeili but concluded he had been overweight for the fight and could not have taken part wilkinson return unlikely jonny wilkinson looks set to miss the whole of the rbs six nations england world cup winning fly half said last week he was hoping to recover from his latest injury in time to play some role in the championship but rob andrew coach of wilkinson club side newcastle said that with only two games left to play wilkinson was unlikely to be fit in time it would be irresponsible to put him straight into test match andrew told the times wilkinson is recovering from knee injury which followed long term neck and arm injuries he has not played for england since the world cup final in november since when the stuttering world champions have lost nine of their matches wilkinson is aiming to make his third start to the season in the zurich premiership match against harlequins on march that game is the day after england play italy in the six nations and six days before their final match of the championship against scotland we are hoping jonny will be ready in fortnight but it is touch and go said andrew his recovery is going very well and the key now is how he is reintroduced to playing and with it goal kicking he will probably have to come off the bench to start and it would be ridiculous and irresponsible to put him straight back into test match we can afford to get it wrong with knee injury we are in touch with england and they are relaxed about it despite not playing for england wilkinson is still hoping to make the lions tour to new zealand this summer lions coach sir clive woodward has not set deadline for when wilkinson has to start playing again in order to be considered for selection castaignede fires laporte warning former france fly half thomas castaignede has warned the pressure is mounting on coach bernard laporte following their defeat by wales france suffered shock loss against the welsh at the weekend after looking on course for an easy win castaignede told bbc sport the pressure is big on laporte after huge loss to new zealand slim win over scotland and miracle against england but the french have to get behind him and the team at lansdowne road following victories over south africa and australia in november france were deemed by many to be the world leading side but they were then trounced by new zealand and only just beat scotland after the scots had try disallowed in their six nations opener it then took some woeful spot kicking from charlie hodgson and olly barkley to help them to victory against england at twickenham lt castaignede said you can say any of those results have eased the pressure on laporte had england kickers not been so bad the position in the six nations would be very different now laporte has been criticised for france negative tactics in their wins over scotland and england but his side played more free flowing style against wales making mockery of the opposition defence in the first half before suffering shock turnaround in fortunes after the interval all the chat in france has been about how france will play against ireland said castaignede ahead of the march tie everyone wants to see the sort of play we saw against wales but everyone also wants win castaignede veteran of international caps admitted the french would go in as underdogs against ireland going to ireland is never easy but the way they re playing right now it harder than ever said castaignede they re very experienced and don often lose at home they ve got some great forwards and some electric runners on the break despite praising the irish he claimed the welsh had the upper hand in the six nations run in ireland have such good pack but wales are something else on the break he added at the weekend they were simply awesome as frenchman it was disappointing to see but you had to admire it their commitment to every cause can make them win this championship the year old also tipped yann delaigue to start ahead of frederic michalak at number after an impressive display in paris last weekend delaigue played really well and admittedly michalak played well too said castaignede just glad not the one who has to make the decision munster cup tie switched to spain munster heineken cup quarter final tie against biarritz on april has been switched to real sociedad paseo de anoeta stadium in san sebastian real ground holds whereas the parc des sports aguilera in biarritz has capacity of just the irish province will be given at least tickets the decision to move was difficult one but as we considered the fans as one of our primary objectives said biarritz chairman marcel martin we hope we will be rewarded as huge crowd behaving in the best rugby tradition the match will be the first heineken cup fixture to be played in spain and is expected to attract the biggest ever attendance for rugby match in the country ulster were the last irish team to play at the paseo de anoeta stadium where they faced euskarians side during pre season tour in bryan twins keep us hopes alive the united states kept the davis cup final alive with victory in saturday doubles rubber leaving spain ahead going into the final day masters cup champions mike and bob bryan thrashed juan carlos ferrero and tommy robredo in front of partisan crowd in seville victory would have given spain the title but they were outclassed in sunday reverse singles carlos moya takes on andy roddick before rafael nadal faces mardy fish it feels good but it not going to be as good if we don win two tomorrow said mike bryan it feels good to give those guys another shot and spain has to go to sleep on that bob bryan added really confident in andy winning that first match and then anything can happen spain coach jordi arrese chose to rest year old nadal in the doubles after his epic singles win over roddick on friday he was replaced by former world number one ferrero but the spanish pair were out of their depth against one of the world best doubles teams the year old bryan twins have won all four of their davis cup matches this year and they quickly silenced the huge crowd at the olympic stadium racing through the opening set to love the spaniards then twice surrendered breaks of serve at the start of the second before the bryans broke to go ahead and served out when robredo dropped serve in the opening game of the third set the match was all but over and the unflappable bryan brothers powered on to an impressive win ferrero who was upset to be dropped for friday singles hinted at further dissatisfaction after the defeat it was difficult game against the best doubles players he said they have everything calculated and we had very little to do was bit surprised that was named to play the doubles match because hardly play doubles arrese said juan carlos hasn played at all badly he played the right way but the bryans are great doubles players klinsmann issues lehmann warning germany coach jurgen klinsmann has warned goalkeeper jens lehmann he may have to quit arsenal to keep his world cup dreams alive lehmann is understudy to oliver kahn in the german squad but has lost his place to manuel alumnia at highbury klinsmann said it will be difficult for any of our players if he is not first choice at his club if jens is not arsenal number one keeper that is problem for me he must be playing regularly lehmann is desperate to keep his place in the germany squad when the country hosts the world cup in klinsmann added if he is not playing regularly he cannot be germany number one keeper or even number two keeper the situation for jens is that he is currently the number two keeper at arsenal this could be critical if it remains the same during next season wada will appeal against ruling the world anti doping agency wada will appeal against the acquittal of kostas kenteris and katerina thanou on doping charges if the iaaf does not the pair were cleared of charges relating to missing dope tests by the greek athletics federation last week wada chairman dick pound said am convinced the iaaf will appeal against the decision and we will support them but if they accept the federation ruling we will go before the court of arbitration for sport he added kenteris lawyer gregory ioannidis reacted angrily to pound comments comments like these only help to embarrass the sporting governing bodies create hostage situation for the iaaf and strengthen our case further he told bbc sport kenteris and thanou had been charged with avoiding drugs tests in tel aviv chicago and athens and failing to notify anti doping officials of their whereabouts before the olympics they withdrew from the athens games after missing drugs test at the olympic village on august but an independent tribunal ruled that the duo had not been informed that they needed to attend drugs test in athens however their former coach christos tzekos was banned for four years by the tribunal kenteris and thanou still have to face trial on charges brought separately by greek prosecutors of missing the drugs tests and faking motorcycle accident to avoid testing at the athens games edu blasts arsenal arsenal brazilian midfielder edu has hit out at the club for stalling over offering him new contract edu deal expires next summer and he has been linked with spanish trio real madrid barcelona and valencia he told bbc sport not sure if want to stay or not because the club have let the situation go on this far if they had really wanted to sign they should have come up with an offer six months before indicating they wanted to sign me and that made me think edu brother and representative amadeo fensao has previously said that arsenal current offer to the midfielder was well short of what he was seeking and edu added my brother is due to come to london on thursday there is meeting planned for or january to sort it out with arsenal now have choice to stay or go want to sort it out as soon as possible that in the best interests of both the club and myself going to make my decision after the meeting later this week edu is now able to begin negotiations with other clubs because fifa regulations allow players to start talks six months before their contracts expire the midfielder who broke in to the brazilian national side in admitted he had been flattered to have been linked with the three spanish giants edu said ve just heard stories from the news that the madrid president florentino perez the valencia people as well as barcelona are interested that nice but ve never talked to them so can say they want me sign last month wenger said he we was hopeful edu would sign new deal and played down suggestions that the lure of club like real madrid would be too strong for edu edu added that he had been encouraged by wenger support for him still have good relationship with arsene wenger he always said he wants me to sign calder fears for scottish rugby former scotland international finlay calder fears civil war at the sru could seriously hamper his country rbs six nations campaign four members of the executive board including the chairman david mackay have resigned after simmering row and calder said this is terrible news for every level of scottish rugby david is successful businessman and thought that if anybody could transform the negative atmosphere and rising debt level it was him mackay executive board has been in power struggle with the general committee which contains members elected by scotland club sides he has been driven out by people who seem happier waging civil war than addressing the central issue that professional rugby can be run by amateurs said calder in fact don understand why we are still having this argument years after professionalism arrived but don believe the rest of the sru will take this lying down think the banks will be dismayed at this decision and ultimately it is them who pull the strings so wouldn be surprised if they reviewed their position but in the wider picture what message does this send out he thought the work of scotland coaches who have been attempting to arrest the decline of the national side would be made much more difficult matt williams and willie anderson must be wondering what have we walked into here said calder and we can now expect weeks of arguments and acrimony just at time when we should be looking forward to the six nations championship am very very disappointed more than you can imagine why do so many scots have this knack of turning on each other when the going gets tough davenport dismantles young rival top seed lindsay davenport booked her place in the last of the australian open with convincing win over nicole vaidisova of the czech republic the american had too much power for her year old opponent breaking twice in the first set and once in the second the german born vaidisova rallied well at times but was unable to find way back after falling behind in the opening set davenport who closed out with an ace plays karolina sprem in the next round was fully expecting tough opponent and was able to play well enough to get through it said davenport think she hits some great shots she made some errors but probably some inexperience played role in that but she so young and obviously has big game and has many many years to improve on that sprem the croatian th seed saw off russia elena likhovtseva former world number one powered her way into the fourth round with straight sets win over anna smashnova the th seed from israel stuck with williams until in the first set before it became one way traffic the american made unforced errors but was still good enough to romp through the contest in exactly an hour she reeled off nine straight games to finish winner remains on course to become the first australian to win her home title since chris neil in the th seed equalled her best performance at grand slam event when she beat unseeded russian nadia petrova to reach the fourth round after tough first set molik grew in confidence and won in just minutes she will now meet venus williams bring it on said the year old played pretty well and it was nice to get through in straight sets we were destined to meet guess williams said referring to her match with molik it will be huge match for her in australia can tell she probably very motivated by that so need to get out there and play well beat slovakia daniela hantuchova in rollercoaster match dementieva came through becoming the seventh russian woman to reach the last in melbourne the match lasted almost three hours and featured service breaks including three in the final set when dementieva held her nerve to seal the win she now faces after the swiss th seed beat american abigail spears french open champion received free ride into the last after lisa raymond was forced to withdraw raymond the th seeded american was ruled out after sustaining left abdominal muscle tear in the doubles myskina the third seed now plays france who beat francesca schiavone of italy extremely disappointed because couldn have asked to play better in my first two matches raymond said ivanovic seals canberra victory serbia ana ivanovic captured her first wta title with straight sets victory over hungarian melinda czink in the final of the canberra classic the year old took minutes to take the match ivanovic beat czink in the last round of qualifying but the hungarian made the main draw as lucky loser after katarina srebotnik withdrew injured ivanovic said was really nervous in the beginning but pulled through and didn do too much wrong junior wimbledon finalist last year she added it my first wta title and to win it has really given me more energy to practice and improve ivanovic will play nd seed iveta benesova of the czech republic in the first round said of the australian open in melbourne lewis francis eyeing world gold mark lewis francis says his olympic success has made him determined to bag world championship gold in the year old pipped maurice greene on the last leg of the relay in athens to take top honours for team gb but individually the birchfield harrier has yet to build on his world junior championship win four years ago the gold medal in athens has made me realise that can get to the top level and want to get there again it can happen don see why not he said lewis francis has still to decided what events will feature in his build up to the worlds with one exception he has confirmed his participation in the norwich union grand prix in birmingham on february where he will take on another member of britain victorious men relay team jason gardener over he added it bit too early to make any predictions for helsinki but have my eyes open and know can be the best in the world stevens named in england line up england have named bath prop matt stevens in the starting line up for their six nations match against ireland at lansdowne road on sunday fellow bath prop duncan bell will start on the bench as coach andy robinson makes just one change to the team that was beaten by france it will be stevens first start after two caps as replacement against the all blacks last year leicester duo ollie smith and andy goode have been drafted onto the bench stevens takes over from phil vickery who suffered broken arm playing for gloucester last weekend confident matt will grasp this opportunity and make his mark against ireland said robinson all three players have shown outstanding form of late most recently in the england win against france and for their club added robinson selection beckons when players demonstrate such consistent ability this game against ireland will be massive we recognise it must win game for us this season england confirmed that

matt dawson new deal the year old world cup winning scrum half has impressed since joining the london side from northampton this summer on one year contract wasps coach warren gatland told the daily mirror we have not yet offered matt new contract but we will be doing so very happy with his contribution and think he good enough to play for another couple of years dawson played vital part in england world cup win last year but has fallen out of favour with new coach andy robinson after missing training session in september however he hopes the new deal will help him regain his england place rugby is still my priority and there still burning desire within me to play the best rugby possibly can he said know within myself if was given the chance could play for england again know fit enough strong enough skilful enough barbarians new zealand new zealand proved too strong for an australian dominated barbarians to round off their unbeaten northern hemisphere tour with an easy win rico gear ran in two of the all blacks seven tries in what was predominantly second string line up the baa baas did threaten scoring tries through albert van den bergh xavier rush and andrea lo cicero but never looked like winning all black aaron mauger was in good form with the boot adding points the all blacks featured only two of the side which started last weekend emphatic test victory over france in paris while the baa baas had nine wallabies in their starting line up and new zealand coach graham henry said it was quality performance against very experienced side and number of young guys came through very well they learnt from the older players and this was way of thanking the guys who had been mentoring them on the tour but the running rugby the crowd had been hoping for rarely materialised marty holah got the all blacks onslaught under way with his fifth minute try before rush hit back moments later but new zealand went ahead once more as gear made use of the space vacated by temporarily injured chris latham to slide in ma nonu then found his way through the barbarians defence to give his side half time lead the hosts failed to ignite in the second half and the moment gear scored his second just after the interval there was only ever going to be one winner lo cicero the sole european for the barbarians bundled over for try to briefly curtail the deficit but the match was blighted by controversy moments later when justin marshall was felled with high tackle by jimmy cowan referee andy turner waved play on and casey laulala coasted in for his side fifth try jermoe keino and piri weepu both added tries to the all blacks tally before the final whistle while van den bergh gained some consolation for the baa baas after the match barbarians coach bob dwyer warned that south african flanker schalk burger needed proper off season break to maintain his standards burger was recently crowned player of the year by both his peers and the international rugby board but has struggled for form in recent weeks it his first year at that level and he was phenomenal up until the end of the southern hemisphere season don think he played anywhere near that level on tour he said leary agrees new villa contract aston villa boss david leary signed three and half year contract extension on thursday securing his future at the club until summer leary future was in question but villa chairman doug ellis said he was happy to secure the deal david record since his arrival in is excellent and he shares the board amibitions in taking this club forward he told villa website for this reason it was important we got this right leary put pen to paper after deals were sorted for his right hand men roy aitken and steve mcgregor it was important to me roy and steve an integral part of my team should stay for the same time leary said on thursday ahead of signing his new deal someone has to try and put aston villa back where they should belong and up for the challenge earlier in december there were rumours leary would quit if he is not offered new deal before the end of the season but he denied that saying he was happy to take on the challenge of improving villa fortunes in the long term want to make sure by the end of the five years would have been in charge that villa are achieving top six finishes in the premiership on regular basis said leary who took over at villa park in may but to achieve that and take the next step forward we do need to bring in quality players would like couple next month if at all possible to set us on the way meanwhile leary has rapped skipper olof mellberg for his comments before sunday derby with birmingham mellberg spoke of his dislike of villa rivals ahead of the match which steve bruce side won ve had more than quiet word with olof it been said within the whole group not as one to one he told villa website you shouldn leave yourself open to be shot down you shouldn give people the chance to take cheap shots at you and he set himself up for that moya sidesteps davis cup in carlos moya has chosen not to help spain try and defend the davis cup crown they won in seville in november moya led spain to victory over the usa but wants to focus on the grand slams in although insists he will return to the davis cup in after two years of total commitment with the davis cup team have taken this difficult decision to concentrate on the regular circuit said moya they know that after this season they can count on me again if they so wish the french open champion is determined to make an impact in the major events after spending much of the last eight years in the top at the age of have set some tough goals in my professional career and this season need to fix my objectives on specific dates and tournaments he said since the davis cup in seville have been working on my condition as well as technical and medical aspects of my game which will allow me to come into the big events of the year in top form moya began with victory in the chennai open on sunday gallas sees two horse race chelsea william gallas believes they will battle it out with arsenal for the premiership in the coming months it ll be two horse race all the way to the end of the season because we are both going to give it everything he told bbc sport you need to be good and you need lot of luck you need bit of both but it will be as hard for the arsenal players as it is for the chelsea boys we know that we have got the power in our hands just now added gallas but you never know what is going to happen in football two seasons ago manchester united picked up so many points towards the end of the season when they won the title obviously nobody at chelsea wants to come second but you never know what happens in football we will be challenging to come first as much as every arsenal player will be challenging to come first gallas has been given extra confidence by the impact manager jose mourinho has had since taking over as manager during the summer and the french international defender believes mourinho is perfectly suited to boss the squad of chelsea stars and says his managerial expertise will prevent any player revolt it only normal when you have got team put together of such big names that you put the finishing touch to it and the finishing touch at chelsea is fantastic manager like mourinho he said he is the icing on the cake at the club he has this fantastic knack of thinking of everything another incredible quality that mourinho has is that every player even though the fans may consider them to be stars within the dressing room they are absolutely equal mourinho reminds everyone but he doesn have to because he has created wonderful atmosphere where everybody is playing and laughing every day it is changed dressing room from the atmosphere there was last year beckham rules out management move real madrid midfielder david beckham has no plans to become manager when his playing career is over am not interested in being coach but would like to have football schools the england captain said on television station canal plus have wanted to do that since went to the bobby charlton school going to open one in london and one in la my second passion is charity work am an ambassador for unicef and it gives me great pride but beckham revealed that his immediate priority was winning the spanish league title with real madrid real slipped to points behind leaders barcelona with defeat at the hands of sevilla on wednesday beckham admitted it disappointing and frustrating to see the results considering the team we have would really like to win la liga with real madrid have been here two years and we still have not done it in wide ranging interview beckham also revealed that his sending off against argentina and the resulting media storm had been the most significant moment in his career asked for his worst memory he said to be sent off against argentina it was not for the sending off but for what happened afterwards was lucky because had manager sir alex ferguson who supported me and strong family behind me but believe that changed me believe it changed me for the better moore questions captaincy brian moore believes the england captain should not be full back jason robinson has led the team during their opening three defeats in the six nations tournament in the absence of fly half jonny wilkinson the world champions have struggled since the retirement of former captain martin johnson lock forward and former england captain moore told the bbc full backs are too far away from the action that not reflection on robinson personally he added just think the point of influence needs to move closer to the pack which is after all where games usually start and finish moore says lack of cohesion in the forwards is one of the reasons why england have lost against wales france and ireland in this year tournament assertiveness in the pack isn there we re not getting enough people into the breakdowns he explained wer not getting quick ball which means the backs are being stifled their creativity depends on quick ball and we re not getting that with injuries depriving him of key players like wilkinson coach andy robinson has given youngsters such as harry ellis and jamie noon chance and moore believes the last two games against italy and scotland are good opportunity to experiment further the problem is the players that are around to replace the icons which have been lost because of retirement and injury don have the requisite experience moore added you can do anything about that but play them there are players who have been knocking on the door it time for them to be looked at in these last two games because there nothing on them we then go into next season with greater certainty of who can and cannot handle the pressure of international rugby ajax refuse to rule out jol move ajax have refused to reveal whether tottenham boss martin jol is on the dutch champions shortlist to become the amsterdam club new coach jol who has coached in his native holland has guided spurs to the premiership top eight an ajax spokesman told bbc sport the coach must fit our profile coach who understands the dutch league and offensive and distinctive football we need to find solution soon so someone is in place for next season ronald koeman quit as ajax boss last week after their exit from the uefa cup jol has been linked with the vacant post at ajax with reports saying he has fallen out with spurs sporting director frank arnesen but in statement on spurs website jol said happy here not in discussion with anyone else don want to go elsewhere ajax have enlisted the help of dutch legend johann cruyff currently consultant at barcelona to help find new head coach cruyff has admitted he has been impressed by the way former rfc waalwijk coach jol has turned round spurs fortunes since taking over from jacques santini tonny bruins slot and ruud krol are currently in charge of ajax who are third in the dutch league wenger shock at newcastle dip arsenal manager arsene wenger has admitted he is at loss to explain why newcastle are languishing in the bottom half of the table the gunners travel to st james park on wednesday with newcastle th in the premiership after troubled season and wenger said at the beginning of the season you would expect them to be fighting for the top four don know how they got to be where they are it looks to me from the outside that they have many injuries arsenal go into the game on the back of victory over fulham on sunday and wenger added the best way to prepare for game is to win the previous one we will go to newcastle in good shape fatigue won play too big part in the next few weeks as we have players coming back so can rotate bit more we do not play season with players and believe that all of our squad deserve chance in the team striker thierry henry along with robert pires scored against fulham and henry afterwards described the display as beautiful to watch he said what matters is winning and the three points of course that is the only thing that really matters but it is more enjoyable when you play like we did against fulham we are playing as team and that is important because there were some games when we maybe were not there as team and suffered for that those were games we lost lewis francis turns to christie mark lewis francis has stepped up his preparations for the new season by taking advice from british sprint icon linford christie the year old is set to compete at sheffield this weekend and will then take on maurice greene and kim collins in birmingham on february training in wales and getting advice from linford

this has been brought about by eating the right foods and cutting out the snacks it is just discipline and being more focused about what am doing am still keeping up my weights work and can see the improvement in my running despite playing his part in britain successful relay team lewis francis still feels the frustration of missing out on the individual final at the olympics that was heartbreaking but had made it to the semi final and for me on personal level that was an achievement just have to be patient and build up for the next olympics that is my goal and whatever do between now and then will be geared to making the final tottenham bid for forest duo nottingham forest have confirmed they have received an bid from tottenham for andy reid and michael dawson reid rejected

players brett ormerod and darren kenton spurs had seen previous bids of and for reid rejected by the championship club reaction from spanish press england defeat to spain on wednesday dominated the back and front pages of the country press on thursday controversy was in no short supply with racist abuse of england black players wayne rooney petulance and england inept performance but what did the spanish press make of the affair bbc sport looks at the reaction there is little coverage of the racist chanting on wednesday night game but as does cover the english reaction to the pre match comments from spain coach luis aragones who highlighted britain colonial past when probed about his own remarks regarding thierry henry in october journalist guillem balague writes in our country where multi culturalism is new thing we are in nappies dealing with these things and have naivety which makes the english nervous marca refers in passing to the booing of england black players but only after referring to the cheers of ole which greeted the long periods of spanish possession aragones no comment to questions about racism after the match is also highlighted as marca focuses on the spanish coach praise for his players serbia montenegro world cup qualifying win in belgium which could make qualification tougher for spain seems to be of greater importance elsewhere the spanish media criticises its english counterparts for stoking up the racism issue were there racist chants against some players this hasn happened in the spanish league and spain for many years said spanish federation press officer fernando garrido so you english reporters should ask yourselves what you have done to contribute to all this and spanish daily abc accuses english reporters of launching witch hunt against aragones perhaps it was because their team had played so poorly and they wanted to divert attention towards this muddled issue the paper says what the boy in the bernabeu did was odd rooney seemed intent to kick any spanish player who approached him yet rooney is seen only as the worst example of many england miscreants with gary neville criticised for continuing the feud between manchester united and arsenal for his tackles on jose reyes ashley cole treatment of joaquin and frank lampard foul on reyes are also lambasted for their ugliness marca headline says it all wayne rooney se volvi loco en el bernab wayne rooney became crazy in the bernabeu rooney display alarms the writer in particular three chilling fouls on joaquin casillas and marchena which could well have left them in the infirmary and like as marca criticises gary neville for leaving message on reyes ankle to remind him of the manchester united arsenal clash this month spain first half performance is showered with praise with xavi singled out as the biggest star xavi did things on wednesday which were worthy of maradona the paper beams adding what work rate what dynamism what vision what leadership what midfield player on controversial evening as offers one seemingly undeniable viewpoint spanish football players played better football than the english more plaudits are given to the home team with jaime vargas lauding the manner in which spain dominated england with order and quality the paper adds the bad thing about spain england was that it lasted only minutes after which succession of changes prevented any real competition vargas does not mention england two galacticos simply adding in ps have not forgotten to speak of beckham and owen they forgot to play london hope over chepkemei london marathon organisers are hoping that banned athlete susan chepkemei will still take part in this year race on april chepkemei was suspended from all competition until the end of the year by athletics kenya after failing to report to national training camp we are watching it closely said london race director david bedford there is long way to go before the race and we are hoping the situation will be satisfactorily resolved the camp in embu was to prepare for the iaaf world cross country championships later this month chepkemei however took part and finished third in last sunday world best race in puerto rico the year old has finished second to paula radcliffe in the and london races as well as in november new york city marathon moyes turn on beattie dismissal everton manager david moyes will discipline striker james beattie after all for his headbutt on chelsea defender william gallas the scot initially defended beattie whose dismissal put everton on the back foot in game they ultimately lost saying gallas overreacted but he has had rethink after looking over the video evidence again he said believe that should set the record straight by conceding that the dismissal was right and correct moyes added my comments on saturday came immediately after the final whistle and at point when had only had the opportunity to see one very quick re run of the incident the club website also reported that beattie who seemed unrepentant after saturday match insisting gallas would have stayed down lot longer if he had headbutted him has now apologised moyes continued although the incident was totally out of character james has never even been suspended before in his career his actions were unacceptable and had detrimental effect on his team mates james did issue formal apology to myself his team mates and to the everton supporters immediately after the game and that was the right thing to have done he will now be subjected to the normal club discipline he is competitive player but fair player and know how upset he is by what has happened however must say that do still believe the chelsea player in question did go down too easily speaking immediately after the game moyes said don think it was sending off have been centre half in my time and would have been ashamed to have gone down as easily as that not in million years would john terry have gone down in the same way have never heard of anybody butting somebody from behind while you are running after them what has happened to big strong centre halves thought it was push initially and still don think it was sending off an angry beattie initially said he gallas would have stayed down lot longer if had headbutted him can tell you it wasn an intentional headbutt we were chasing ball into the corner and william gallas was looking over his shoulder and blocking me off he was stopping as we were running and said to myself if you re going to stay in my way ll go straight over you our heads barely touched and it wasn an intentional headbutt nadal marches on in mexico rafael nadal continued his run of fine form to beat guillermo canas and reach the mexican open semis in

encounter ac milan defender jaap stam says manchester united know they made mistake by selling him in the sides meet at old trafford in the champions league game on wednesday and the year old dutchman presence is sure to add spice to the fixture united made mistake in selling me stam told uefa champions magazine was settled at manchester united but they wanted to sell me if club want to sell you there is nothing you can do you can be sold like cattle sir alex ferguson surprised the football world and stam by selling the dutchman to lazio for in august the decision came shortly after stam claimed in his autobiography that ferguson had tapped him up when he was at psv eindhoven but ferguson insisted he sold the defender because the transfer fee was too good to refuse for player past his prime the affair still rankles with the dutchman was settled at manchester united had even just ordered new kitchen but they wanted to sell me he said in what other industry can good employee be ushered out the door against their wishes of course you can refuse to go but then the club have the power to put you on the bench don agree that players control the game there have been opportunities to confront them in the newspapers but have turned them down what the point wednesday game at old trafford will provide an intriguing confrontation between united young attackers wayne rooney and cristiano ronaldo and milan veteran defence of stam paolo maldini cafu and alessandro costacurta stam says rooney teenage stardom is in stark contract to his own start in the game we can all be wayne rooneys at his age was training to be an electrician and thought my chance of becoming professional footballer had gone he said starting late can be good thing some kids who start early get bored had my youth having fun drinking beers blowing up milk cannisters it sounds strange but it tradition where grew up in kampen and had done all the things wanted to do wales critical of clumsy grewcock wales coach mike ruddock says england lock danny grewcock needs to review his actions after he kicked dwayne peel trouble flared at ruck in the first half of wales win in cardiff as grewcock came recklessly over the top with his boot leaving peel bloodied grewcock was sin binned with wales captain gareth thomas for retaliation it up to the citing commissioner said ruddock not saying it deliberate but grewcock did similar thing for bath against leinster last june grewcock was banned from rugby for two months for reckless use of boot in match against new zealand six years earlier also in new zealand grewcock became only the second england player to be sent off in tests the player himself and his captain jason robinson have both said that the clash with peel was accidental if the ball is at the back of the ruck and feel can step over and disrupt it then will do that said grewcock but ruddock feels that the england man should be more careful the boy himself should look at his actions it was clumsy piece of footwork he said he great player and don want to knock him we won be calling for the match commissioner to review the incident not going to go too far with the lad it could just be clumsy action and dwayne had just minor cut the referee interpretation was that grewcock was attempting to step over the ruck ruddock also warned his rbs nations championship rivals that his team can make massive improvements we created more opportunities and also squandered them by taking more contact and playing more individually said the coach we ve looked through things on the video debrief and there were definitely lot of chances that we wasted in the forthcoming games ruddock may use penalty hero gavin henson as his first choice kicker in place of stephen jones our first aim was to get gavin settled into the team but it something we ll talk about in selection this week said ruddock bellamy under new fire newcastle boss graeme souness has reopened his dispute with craig bellamy after claiming the welshman was not good enough for the magpies bellamy left newcastle to join celtic on loan after major row with souness souness who refused to refer to the year old by name said bellamy did not score enough goals the chap that just gone has scored goals season in his time in senior football half of those weren even in the top flight said souness that not good enough for striker at club like this we need to have two strikers who are near goals on regular basis bellamy turned down move to birmingham in favour of joining celtic after disagreement about the welsh international playing out of position quickly escalated earlier in the week souness had said that he risked losing the confidence of the players and damaging his own reputation if he had not taken hard line after bellamy accused him of lying there are certain things you can forgive and forget said souness but if been seen to be weak in this case there was no future for me with the players in the dressing room or any job have after newcastle he could then return to st james park and he says that he wants to however it would seem unlikely he will play for newcastle again as long as souness remains in charge england defensive crisis grows england defensive worries have deepened following the withdrawal of tottenham ledley king from the squad to face holland chelsea john terry and wayne bridge are also out leaving coach sven goran eriksson with real problem for wednesday match at villa park injured rio ferdinand and sol campbell were both left out of the squad and matthew upson has already pulled out wes brown and jamie carragher are likely to be the makeshift partnership terry the captain of chelsea as they push for the premiership title would have been certain starter in the absence of campbell and ferdinand but now he has pulled out with bruised knee and is likely to be replaced by carragher alongside brown manchester united brown last played for england in the defeat by australia at upton park in february the year old was only called into the squad on sunday night as cover following the enforced withdrawal of upson who has hamstring injury and brown now looks certain to add to his tally of seven senior appearances for england king was forced to pull out after his groin injury was assessed by england medical staff eriksson has still not decided whether to call up any further back up having already summoned phil neville after bridge pulled out with foot injury iaaf will contest greek decision the international association of athletics federations will appeal against the acquittal of greek athletes kostas kenteris and katerina thanou the high profile duo were cleared of doping offences by the greek athletics federation segas last month now the iaaf will lodge an appeal with the court of arbitration for sport cas and has suspended both athletes an iaaf statement said the doping review board concluded that the decision is erroneous the statement continued both athletes cases will be refered to arbitration before the cas the decision in both cases will be final and binding segas said the iaaf appeal was expected and understandable now we are going to await the final result which we cannot prejudge said segas chairman vassilis sevastis kenteris who won olympic gold at the olympics and thanou were suspended by the iaaf last december after failing to take routine drugs tests before the athens games however the independent tribunal overturned those bans clearing the sprinters of avoiding tests in tel aviv chicago and athens and failing to notify anti doping officials of their whereabouts before the olympics kenteris lawyer gregory ioannidis described the iaaf decision as not unexpected but told bbc sport he did not expect the organisation to take action so quickly the iaaf timing is extremely surprising and it creates concerns and questions said ioannidis the iaaf has not yet received the complete file of proceedings which include statements testimonies the closing speeches of defence counsel and nine audio tapes we have the evidence and it is time the world discovered the truth kenteris and thanou dramatically withdrew from last summer olympics after missing drugs test at the olympic village on august the pair then spent four days in hospital claiming they had been injured in motorcycle crash it was the international olympic committee who demanded the iaaf investigate the affair thanou and kenteris still face criminal trial later this year for allegedly avoiding the test and then faking motorcycle accident unclear future for striker baros liverpool forward milan baros is uncertain whether he remains part of boss rafa benitez plans after being dropped for the carling cup final baros who is liverpool leading scorer this season denied reports of row with benitez but claims he is mystified at being left on the bench he told czech newspaper daily sport don know why didn play on sunday didn argue with anybody was disappointed but am not thinking of leaving right now the czech international came on as substitute after minutes but could not prevent his side losing to chelsea after extra time baros denied suggestions he wanted to leave the millennium stadium before the match upon learning of his omission from the starting line up but his admission that he guessed something like this was going to happen on saturday will do little to quell claims of falling out with benitez and although baros insisted thoughts of quitting anfield are not in my mind right now he admitted everything is possible yelling takes cardiff hat trick european cross country champion hayley yelling completed hat trick of wins in the reebok cardiff cross challenge in bute park on sunday afternoon the part

with england lewis moody has flown to dublin to join england camp ahead of their rbs six nations game against ireland on sunday despite joining the squad the leicester flanker only has slim chance of playing because of an infection in his finger decision will be taken on saturday as to whether the year old will be declared fit if he fails to recover in time for the game his place at the back of the pack will be taken by andy hazell chris jones will then start the game on the bench the chances of him playing are very slim said coach andy robinson the infection is deeper than was thought moody had to be put on drip in an attempt to force antibiotics through his infected finger he suffered the cut playing against france at twickenham and it became infected during minute outing as replacement for leicester against newcastle last saturday the mud got into it robinson added he has had big course of antibiotics but they haven done the job we hoped they would robinson has already been forced to make one change to the starting line up with bath prop matt stevens coming in for the injured phil vickery the year old has only made starts for his club but has made appearances from the bench it can be frustrating but ve had lot more game time this season and ready for it stevens said ve been on tour with these boys and ve been in the england set up for two years so know the calls and the way they play stevens will be winning his third cap on sunday after coming on twice as replacement on the tour to new zealand last year robinson has confirmed that fly half charlie hodgson will be the first choice kicker despite his three missed penalties and drop goal against france charlie state of mind is very good said robinson obviously we are all disappointed we lost the french game and the circumstances in which we did but he responded well last week in his goalkicking for sale and he will be our first choice kicker this week robinson also admits his side must improve their line out work against irish duo malcolm kelly and paul connell one of the most effective partnerships in the game in each game we ve missed number of line outs he added it cost us the game against wales but it has improved it was better against france and will have to go up another notch against ireland it will be huge battle look at the way they tore us apart last year if it doesn function we will be in

england in this season opening irb sevens tournament the dubai sevens which start on thursday was delighted with his award there are so many great sevens players on the circuit at the moment that this

been scheduled to play qualifier sebastien de chaunac who beat world number five guillermo coria in round one but rusedski was unable to take to the court because of problem with the left hand side of

match of the day sixth seed feliciano lopez defeated ivo karlovic there were also wins for slovakia karol beck and croatian duo ivan ljubicic and mario ancic wilkinson to miss ireland match england will have to take on ireland in the six nations without captain and goal kicker jonny wilkinson according to his newcastle boss rob andrew wilkinson who had targeted the february match for his international comeback has been missed by england not least for his goal kicking jonny not fit yet falcons chief andrew told bbc radio five live he won be fit for dublin there no doubt about that but he might be fit for scotland and italy the year old has not played for england since the world cup final after succession of injuries england who have lost three six nations games in row wasted half time lead in their defeat to france goal kickers charlie hodgson and olly barkley missed six penalty attempts and drop goal between them they ve probably got two of the best english kickers in the premiership in hodgson and barkley added andrew former england fly half and goal kicker they re both pretty good kickers charlie is good kicker week in week out but it all about pressure and unfortunately england are just not handling the pressure at the moment andrew also blamed england poor run of recent results on lack of leadership in the side following several high profile retirements and injuries they just didn have that leadership that would have seen them through martin johnson lawrence dallaglio and jonny are obviously huge losses and leadership is so important in those situations he said think it is really difficult for jason robinson to lead the side effectively from full back meanwhile former england full back dusty hare put england mistakes down to lack of mental toughness jonny wilkinson has proved himself cool customer with around an kicking success rate hare told bbc radio five live but natural born toughness comes into it as well as all the practice you do you have to be able to shut out all the outside elements and concentrate on putting the ball between the posts hodgson who has an excellent kicking record with club side sale sharks has introduced crowd noise into his practice routine of late the top golfers don hit the fairway every time and it is the same with goal kicking hare added you need that mental toughness as well to put the ball over but great goal kickers like jonny wilkinson come along very rarely young debut cut short by ginepri fifteen year old donald young first appearance in an atp tennis tournament proved brief as the teenager went out in round one of the san jose open young shot to the top of the junior world rankings when he won the boys singles at january australian open but the wildcard entry was dispatched by fellow american robby ginepri in straight sets in california despite that he was happy with his tour debut it was fun had my chances but they didn come through he said young who beat two players ranked in the top when he was just was only down in the first set before losing of the next games and ginepri six years older than the youngest player to ever win junior slam and top the global standings admitted he was impressed he very talented said ginepri he got long future ahead of him being left handed he was very quick around the court his serve is little deceptive he came into

fight the provisional two year bans imposed on them by the iaaf at an independent tribunal this weekend athletics ruling body took action against the pair for failing to take drugs tests before the athens olympics an independent tribunal of the greek track and field federation will meet to decide whether to ratify the sanction the sprint duo face charges of failing to give information on their location and refusing to submit to drugs test kenteris lawyer gregory ioannidis told bbc sport we refute both charges as unsubstantiated and illogical there have been certain breaches in the correct application of the rules on behalf of the sporting authorities and their officials and these procedural breaches have also violated my client rights there is also evidence that proves the fact that my client has been persecuted ioannidis who is law lecturer at the university of buckingham added one of the important rights and foundations of law and justice that the accused should be presumed innocent unless proved otherwise has been tarnished the panel will also decide on the two year ban imposed on the athletes controversial coach christos tzekos by the iaaf kenteris the olympic champion and thanou the women silver medallist from the same games in sydney quit the olympics on august after failing to give samples on the eve of the opening ceremony testers could not find them at the olympic village and the duo were later admitted to hospital after claiming to have been involved in motorcycle accident they also missed tests in tel aviv chicago and athens before the games in

the right to appeal to the court of arbitration for sport the tribunal hearing will take place at the hellenic olympic committee building it will start at gmt on saturday and is expected to finish early next week the tribunal panel will consist of five members president konstantinos panagopoulos and panagiotis dimakos haralabos hrisanthakis stilianos perakis and ioannis karmis kenteris and thanou also face criminal charges in greece for allegedly faking the motorcycle accident eight criminal charges have been laid against the sprinters as well as tzekos an eyewitness to the accident and hospital officials but there has been speculation that the charges could be dropped mexicans tracking unhappy juninho mexican outfit red sharks veracruz hope to sign juninho if the brazilian decides to leave celtic frustrated at his lack of first team action their president gustavo parente sanchez says juninho does not wish to remain in scottish football anymore agent brian hassell insists that the year old brazilian midfielder is determined to win back his place but if the manager is not going to pick him that different ball game he told the sun that something we have to look at juninho deserves respect he is not little kid hassell warns that juninho could reconsider his future at celtic unless he is given run of games by the end of the january transfer window juninho was signed from middlesbrough during the summer but he has failed to live up to high expectations and has lost his place to year old aiden mcgeady he has caps for brazil and he the best signing celtic ever made insisted hassell he wants to play for martin neill but does martin neill want to play him juninho is not someone who has come through the celtic ranks he deserves much more respect sanchez is bullish about his hopes of prising juninho from the scottish champions although hassell believes mexico would not be his preferred destination we have already spoken with juninho and he said if he has no firm offer from club in spain veracruz will be his destination sanchez told his club official website celtic manager neill is no respecter of reputations the onus is on juninho to force his way into the

hungarian petra mandula on wednesday really excited was confident but didn think it was going to be that easy mirza said after her second round win my aim was to win round here when did that was so

contest italy skipper marco bortolami believes saturday six nations contest against scotland will be scrappy encounter with both sides looking for their first win of the championship the third round game at murrayfield has been billed as wooden spoon decider and bortolami feels the edinburgh contest could end up being bruising battle of the packs it will not be pretty game because both teams are desperate to gain their first win said the lock forward italy have only recorded three wins since they joined the six nations in but two of those have come against scotland this year italy opened up with stubborn display against ireland but ended up losing however they were thoroughly outplayed by an impressive welsh side in rome last time out now the italians travel to edinburgh hoping to claim their first away win in the six nations scotland played extremely well against france in paris but not so well when ireland came to edinburgh said bortolami we are still very disappointed with our last game against wales in rome and we are thoroughly determined to right the wrongs as nation our quest is to be respected as team worthy of place in this tournament and we can only do this by winning games robben plays down european return injured chelsea winger arjen robben has insisted that he only has chance of making return against barcelona in the champions league the year old has been sidelined since breaking foot against blackburn last month chelsea face barcelona at home on march having lost in the first leg and robben told the daily star it is not impossible that will play against barcelona but it is just very very small chance about robben has been an inspirational player for chelsea this season following switch from psv einhoven last summer he added my recovery is going better than we expected few weeks ago but think the barcelona game will come too soon won take any risks and come back too soon fear will help france laporte france coach bernard laporte believes his team will be scared going into their game with england on sunday but claims it will work in their favour the french turned in stuttering performance as they limped to win against scotland in the opening match of the six nations on saturday we will go to twickenham with little fear and it ll give us boost said the french coach he added we are never good enough when we are favourites meanwhile perpignan centre jean philippe granclaude is delighted to have received his first call up to the france squad it incredible the youngster said was not expecting it at all playing with the france team has always been dream and now it has come true and am about to face england at twickenham in the six nations laporte will announce his starting line up on wednesday at the french team training centre in marcoussis near paris fuming robinson blasts officials england coach andy robinson insisted he was livid after his side were denied two tries in sunday six nations loss to ireland in dublin mark cueto first half effort was ruled out for offside before the referee spurned tv replays when england crashed over in the dying minutes absolutely spitting livid there two tries we ve been cost robinson told bbc sport we ve got to go back to technology don know why we didn south african referee jonathan kaplan ruled that cueto was ahead of charlie hodgson when the fly half hoisted his cross field kick for the sale wing to gather kaplan then declined the chance to consult the fourth official when josh lewsey took the ball over the irish line under pile of bodies for what could have been the game winning try think mark cueto scored perfectly legal try and think he should have gone to the video referee on josh lewsey said robinson it is how we use the technology it is there and it should be used am still trying to work out the cueto try have looked at both and they both looked tries we are very disappointed and this will hurt there is no doubt about that we are upset now but the referee is in charge and he has called it his way and we have got to be able to cope with that we did everything we could have done to win the game am very proud of my players and with couple of decisions this could have been very famous victory thought we dominated matt stevens had an awesome game at tighthead prop while the likes of charlie hodgson martin corry and lewis moody all came through well josh lewsey was awesome and every one of the forwards stood up out there given the pressure we were under credit must go to all the players we have done everything but win game of rugby but ireland are good side they defended magnificently and they ve got every chance of winning this six nations england have lost their first three matches in this year six nations and four out of their six games since robinson took over from sir clive woodward in september celts savour grand slam prospect the six nations has heralded new order in northern hemisphere rugby this year and wales and ireland rather than traditional big guns france and england face potential grand slam play off in three weeks time but before that game in cardiff wales must get past scotland at murrayfield while ireland face the not insignificant task of home fixture with the mercurial french no one knows what mood france will be in at lansdowne road on march sublime as in the first half against wales or ridiculous like in the same period against england at twickenham but how the mighty have fallen england sat on rugby summit months ago as world champions and grand slam winners but they have lost nine of their matches since that heady night in sydney and they face the ignominy of what could amount to wooden spoon play off against italy in fortnight england are enduring their worst run in the championship since captain richard hill was dumped in favour of mike harrison after three straight losses in coach andy robinson who took over from the successful sir clive woodward in september has lost phalanx of world cup stars and he is enduring the toughest of teething problems in bedding down his own style with new team the same year that england ruled the roost woeful wales lost all five matches in the six nations and they won only two games against scotland and italy in wales most recent championship title was in and their last grand slam success came in in the era of gareth edwards phil bennett jpr williams et al but welsh rugby fans remain on permanent tenterhooks for the blossoming of new golden age after several false dawns coach mike ruddock may have come up with the team and philosophy to match expectations the fresh verve is inspired by skipper gareth thomas now out with broken thumb accurate kicking from either fly half stephen jones or centre gavin henson rampant martyn williams leading the way up front and exciting runners in the guise of henson and shane williams ireland coach eddie sullivan and captain brian driscoll have got their side buzzing too and they are close to shedding the nearly men tag that has dogged them for the past few years the men from the emerald isle have been six nations runners up for the past two years to france and england but they have not won the title since and last clinched grand slam in as for scotland they have struggled this decade and the wooden spoon winners have not been in the top two since they lifted the title in italy continue the elusive search for their first six nations away win and can still only account for the scalps of scotland twice and wales since joining the elite in coach john kirwan is passionate and dedicated believer in the azzurri but is lacking in raw materials and so to france brilliant one minute inept the next but the reigning champions could quite easily turn on the style in dublin and end up winning the title through the back door ireland though have won three times in their last five meetings welsh romantics would probably prefer glorious victory in the celtic showdown to crown their grand slam but given that ireland have beaten wales in four of their last five meetings the welsh legions are likely to be behind les bleus on march wales want rugby league training wales could follow england lead by training with rugby league club england have already had three day session with leeds rhinos and wales are thought to be interested in similar clinic with rivals st helens saints coach ian millward has given his approval but if it does happen it is unlikely to be this season saints have week training in portugal next week while wales will play england in the opening six nations match on february we have had an approach from wales confirmed saints spokesman it in the very early stages but it is something we are giving serious consideration to st helens who

at murrayfield that would leave the scots as favourites to win the wooden spoon for the second year running have never quit anything in my life apart from maybe painting the kitchen he told bbc sport the support we have been given from murrayfield in my whole time here has been williams has yet to experience an rbs six nations victory after seven attempts and scotland have lost of their games under his leadership but he rejected the comparison made in some media sources with berti vogts recently sacked as scotland football manager after poor run of results how can german football coach and an australian rugby coach have anything in common he asked it is bizarre analogy it is so absurd that it borders on the humorous williams insists that he is revelling in the pressure despite the possibility of second six nations series without victory that is not beyond the realms of possibility he admitted there nothing much between the teams so we could win the next three games or lose them but actually really enjoy seeing how you cope with such pressure as coach it helps the team grow and helps you grow as coach we could have won in paris but for the last five minutes and now we have two defeats but we were confident for those two first games and we are confident we can beat italy too irish finish with home game republic of ireland manager brian kerr has been granted his wish for

marion jones has been opened by the international olympic committee ioc president jacques rogge has set up disciplinary body to look into claims by victor conte of balco laboratories jones who says she is innocent could lose all her olympic medals after conte said he gave her performance enhancing drugs before the sydney olympics but rogge said it was too early to speculate about that hoping only that the truth will emerge any decision on the medals would be taken by the ioc executive board and could hinge on interpretation of rule stating that olympic decisions can only be challenged within three years of the games closing the sydney olympics ended more than four years ago but world anti doping agency chief dick pound said the rule may not apply because the allegations are only coming out now we will find way to deal with that pound said in statement released through her attorney rich nichols jones repeated her innocence and vowed she would be cleared victor conte allegations are not true and the truth will be revealed for the world to see as the legal process moves forward she said conte is someone who is under federal indictment and has record of issuing contradictory inconsistent statements sculthorpe wants lions captaincy paul sculthorpe has admitted he would love to succeed andy farrell as great britain skipper if the wigan star does switch codes

it something ve always wanted to do gladly take it if it was offered to me the year old who captained st helens to challenge cup success last year said following in the footsteps of farrell would be challenge andy would be hard act to follow but it something confident of being up to he said the gb team isn one man team there are lot of good young players who are pushing for places anyway sculthorpe said the rugby league world would understand if farrell did decide to move to rugby union it short career and you have to make of it what you can said sculthorpe nobody can blame him if he does go he done everything in the game of rugby league financially it could set him up for life if he fancies new challenge then who could fault him sculthorpe also called on the rugby league authorities to have serious look at the number of games the top players are being asked to play sean long sculthorpe saints and lions team mate has expressed doubts about his international future think sean situation is to do with the sheer number of games we re playing he said the way he looking at it is that if he can extend his career by couple of years by not playing international rugby then he willing to do that the rfl has got to do something about the fixtures we re playing weeks of the year and it too much lot of the niggly injuries that ve suffered with over the last couple of years have come about because of the lack of rest time st helens have been strongly linked with move for brilliant young forward sonny bill williams and sculthorpe said he would love the year old to come to knowsley road he great player big strong lad who can certainly hit hard in defence but who is also very skilful he said love him to come to st helens who knows what might happen but you want

rugby playing colours all black the haka and more the all blacks charles john munro discovered rugby at london christ college and on his return to nelson he staged new zealand first game nelson town met nelson college on may the town triumphing by two goals to nil instigating game that would become national obsession and come to dominate the country sporting passions the game appealed to the kiwi psyche and quickly spread the native maoris finding particular empathy with the sport warrior ethos in british team led by ae stoddart toured new zealand and australia and soon after maori named joe warbrick and an english ex pat called thomas eyton decided to gather combined new zealand team twenty two maori and four pakiha formed the new zealand native team who played total of matches in new zealand australia and the uk the integration of white and maori was reflecion of enlightened new zealand rugby and society even if the british press were somewhat mystified by the pre match tradition of the maori war dance the haka the other great symbol of new zealand rugby the all black kit with the silver fern on the breast was proposed by tom ellison at the first annual meeting of the new zealand rugby football union in new zealand played their first international against australia in the kiwis triumphing in sydney and the following year an official british touring team came to new zealand for the first time the tourists had gone through australia undefeated but their captain david revell bedell sivright created animosity in new zealand with his patronising attitude the kiwis shocked the rugby world with triumph in wellington sparking great celebrations across the country but bedell sivright churlishly suggested that the victors would have no chance when they visited the uk their opportunity to prove him wrong came in with the first official new zealand tour to europe the tourists won their early games with quick thinking inventive approach but press criticism began to grow over their scrum formation that left roving forward free to disrupt opposition attacks the tactic was effective two late tries seeing the kiwis to win over scotland before ireland were despatched in dublin huge crowd at crystal palace convulsed with laughter at the sight of the haka but the smiles were soon wiped from their faces when the tourists ran in five tries in hammering of england new zealand headed to wales to meet country in the midst of its first golden age and the encounter would be the first in series of controversial clashes between the sides an excellent try on the left wing by teddy morgan sealed win in hard fought encounter at cardiff arms park but post match talk was dominated by bob deans try that was ruled out by scottish referee john dallas dallas said that deans was tackled short but the kiwi said he was dragged back into the field of play after grounding try on his death bed three years later he exclaimed did score that try in cardiff four of the all blacks went over to the newly formed all golds rugby league side soon after the tour but new zealand were strong enough to crush an anglo welsh touring team in the first south africa tour of new zealand in saw honours shared in three test series starting the greatest rivalry in rugby and the long running controversy between the countries over the all blacks inclusion of maori players the awesome all black tourists became known as the invincibles after winning all of their games in france britain and ireland including crushing victory over wales at st helen despite their success the all blacks scrum formation left them somewhat short of possession at times and the flaws were exploited by the springboks in south africa in employing the modern scrum line up against the new zealand rover system for the first time south african teams defeated the all blacks in five games and the test series was drawn two all the controversial new zealand scrum method finally disappeared after the lions tour series won by new zealand the lions manager describing the tactic as cheating prompting the international rugby board to rule that three men had to pack down in the front row of the scrum the all blacks european tour started inauspiciously with an loss to swansea side inspired by teenage schoolboy half backs hayden tanner and willie davies thrilling test at cardiff arms park went to wales although the winning try from geoffrey rees jones was controversial following an illegal claude davey tackle in the build up new zealand next visit to wales in proved difficult as they lost to cardiff and drew at swansea the all blacks were on top in the test with wales at the arms park but the teams were locked at when clem thomas cross kick was gathered by ken jones for famous match winning try the tourists made some amends with wins over the other home nations before success over the barbarians in an arms park thriller new zealand built from that tour and by the time they returned in they were undoubtedly the leading side in the world that made the shock all the greater when drop goal by student john uzzell gave newport an unlikely win over the tourists at rodney parade wilson whinneray side rallied to beat wales their first win at the arms park in four attempts and went unbeaten through the rest of the tour but when they returned home the first question put to them was what happened in newport the only blemish on the record of the awesome tourists was draw with east wales as they beat the full wales team in cardiff to take the lead in the series between the countries for the first time that lead was increased with two comfortable wins for the home side in new zealand in the first time wales had toured the country as an independent team ferocious game at the arms park in was edged by the all blacks measure of revenge for the defeat inflicted on new zealand by the carwyn james inspired lions of james guided llanelli to famous win over the tourists at stradey park though and in the final game of the tour the barbarians defeated the all blacks in cardiff in game regarded by many as the greatest ever played new zealand defeated wales xv at the arms park in non cap game in but it was the game in cardiff that would reignite the history of controversy between the two countries wales were leading with one minute left when andy haden flew to the floor from line out television pictures clearly showed that he dived but english referee roger quittenton was fooled and awarded penalty duly converted by brian mckechnie for win since that infamous game the competition has largely left wales new zealand fixtures as the men in red have slipped from the pinnacle of the world game crushing win for new zealand in cardiff in the welsh rugby union centenary game was sign of things to come the new professionalism in the southern hemisphere game that had left europe behind was shown as the all blacks swatted wales aside in brisbane in the semi final of the inaugural world cup the kiwis went on to claim the cup and would inflict further misery on wales on their ill fated tour of new zealand young talented wales side left britain full of confidence as triple crown winners but one of the greatest ever new zealand teams demolished them and after also taking some fearful beatings in the provincial games wales captain jonathan davies returned home calling for urgent change in the national game but as his views were ignored he along with generation of wales best players chose to head north to rugby league win in cardiff followed for new zealand in and at the world cup wales big talk was made to look embarrassing as the all blacks eased to victory in johannesburg crushing kiwi triumph in wembley followed in and as wales misery increased they turned to new zealand for their salvation in the shape of coaches graham henry and steve hansen there was temporary resurgence in the welsh game but when an experimental new zealand side came to cardiff new millennium stadium in they left with victory bruising defeat followed for wales in hamilton in as hansen built towards the world cup but in australia it was remarkable performance against the all blacks that gave his side renewed hope wales were given no chance going into the game but in the course of the match they rediscovered the value of attacking flair to lead early in the second half new zealand rallied to win but the style shown by wales has been used as an inspiration as they look to better future they now face an all blacks team led by henry and hansen coming to europe with weakened squad at the end of long season an encouraging display against south africa has inspired confident wales camp to believe they can claim their first win over the men in black for over years they have chance but clearly history is not on their side celtic make late bid for bellamy newcastle striker craig bellamy is discussing possible short term loan move to celtic bbc sport understands the welsh striker has rejected move to birmingham after falling out with magpies manager graeme souness the toon boss vowed bellamy would not play again after bitter row over his exclusion for the game against arsenal celtic are in no position to match birmingham offer but stay until the end of the season could suit bellamy while he considers his future according to bellamy agent the player dismissed permanent move to birmingham and it is unlikely that newcastle would allow the player to go on loan to another premiership club bellamy was fined two weeks wages after live tv interview in which he accused souness of lying following very public dispute about what position bellamy should play in the side souness said he can play for me ever again he has been disruptive influence from the minute walked into this football club he can go on television and accuse me of telling lies chairman freddy shepherd described bellamy behaviour as totally unacceptable and totally unprofessional holmes secures comeback victory britain kelly holmes marked her first appearance on home soil since winning double olympic gold with victory at the norwich union international holmes hit the front just before the bell in front of sell out crowd in glasgow and cruised to victory in time of four minutes seconds it was nice to get that out of the way was nervous about whether would actually be able to get round felt good just had to relax and use my racing knowledge said holmes it was all about winning in front of my home crowd the time is irrelevant got round in one piece and didn disgrace myself now it about going forward the reception ve had since the olympics has been amazing and that why wanted to keep running this year because get buzz from the crowd holmes ran tactically perfect race to finish clear of france hind dehiba and russia svetlana cherkasova the olympic and champion time was inside the qualifying mark for the european indoor championships in madrid in march but the year old would not reveal whether she intended to run or not having previously indicated she would leave decision until after the birmingham grand prix on february campbell lifts lid on united feud arsenal sol campbell has called the rivalry between manchester united and the gunners bitter and personal past encounters have stirred up plenty of ill feeling between the sides and they meet again at highbury on tuesday it is just more bitter and personal against united the defender told the guardian newspaper there an edge after all that has happened if we beat them it will be one of our sweetest ever wins especially because of how we lost to them up there last october arsenal lost at old trafford which ended record match unbeaten league run and sparked mini crisis with the gunners winning only three of their next games it had psychological impact on us but again because of the way we were defeated added the year old referring to controversial penalty award for united first goal that was far more upsetting losing like that because they just seem to get away with it you try and balance out over the course of season but ve had so many rough decisions against them you begin to wonder with tensions spilling over afterwards united boss sir alex ferguson was allegedly pelted with pizza in the players tunnel there is little surprise that so much is riding on the return encounter on everyone at arsenal has been waiting for this game said campbell we are up for this one speaking on his long term plans campbell signalled his intent to move abroad before he turns now and in five years time won be in this country that definite italy looks good to me because it would suit my kind of football spain is an option but the idea of tasting new culture and learning another language excites me the most starting little with french of course wolves appoint hoddle as manager glenn hoddle has been unveiled as the new wolves manager the ex england coach has been given six month contract to succeed dave jones who was sacked after the club poor start to the season wolves chairman rick hayward said we re delighted glenn is here he has six month contract

boss when hoddle was manager at southampton delighted to be here said hoddle saw the massive potential that wolves have got and their desire and amibition to get back into the premiership parallels my ambitions stuart gray has done fantastic job as caretaker manager we ve worked together at southampton and delighted to be back with him wolves chief executive jez moxey defended the decision to give hoddle short term contract we hope it will work out for both parties and we extend it for the long term he said most managers want four year contract and then expect it to be paid off if it doesn work out for somebody of glenn calibre to come in on short term contract and put his reputation on the line it demonstrates his commitment and self belief and the potential he thinks is here hayward revealed that hoddle was one of the first to be approached after jones departure he was not available at the time because he was looking at various other things he explained five weeks later we re back on track and this tremendous opportunity for wolves hoddle began his managerial career as player boss with swindon before moving on to chelsea and then taking up the england job his spell in charge of the national side came to an end after the world cup when he made controversial remarks about the disabled in newspaper interview the year old later returned to management with southampton where he again succeeded jones as he has now done at wolves he engineered an upturn in saints fortunes before being lured to white hart lane by tottenham the club where he made his name as player that

linked with return to southampton wolves are currently th in the championship and have home game against millwall on tuesday smith keen on home series return scotland manager walter smith has given his backing to the reinstatement of the home international series such plan is to be proposed by the new chief executive of the northern irish fa howard wells at the next meeting of the four home countries the english fa has expressed doubt as to whether the fixtures could be accommodated at the end of each season but smith said bringing it back would add meaning to friendly games and that something that needed the home international series was done away with in with the traditional scotland england fixture continuing until that game is one smith would be delighted to see reinstated the scotland england match was highlight of the end of the season he added was in italy for their friendly with russia last week and they made seven substitutions while only around fans turned up to watch england were criticised for the draw against holland the way scotland were slammed in the past for poor results in friendlies you have to put performance on in friendly games if you don they can be de motivating it can be dangerous road to go down if players don apply themselves in the manner they should so would support the return of the home internationals the only problem would be fitting them in to the fixture schedule connors rallying cry for british tennis do you have it in your heart how much guts do you have how much do you hate to lose these are the questions jimmy connors will be asking of britain brightest tennis hopes in the months and possibly years to come the american legend swept into london on thursday to announce long term relationship with the lawn tennis association after spending three days at the elite performance winter camp in la manga and the man who epitomised the phrase will to win before lleyton hewitt was even born is clear about the qualities he hopes to convey you know everybody hits the ball well and there very fine line between number one and number said connors was that fine line for long time but if can help want to be part of teaching kids how to win connors is not the first great name to offer his services to the lta his long time rival john mcenroe has repeatedly done the same but connors is at pains to point out that his interest goes well beyond any publicity stunt and he gave glowing recommendation to the work of lta performance director david felgate and his team britain has different attitude the right attitude in taking the game forward and finding the next wimbledon champion said connors that something you don find every day everybody talks good game but not everybody puts that into effect the impression came away with after just seeing david and the other coaches for three days was one like ve never seen before especially over here this is not going to happen overnight there are no miracle workers but you re going in the right direction the year old enthusiasm for the work going on in this country is in marked contrast to his relationship with tennis officials back in america ve had discussions with the usta united states tennis association over number of years he said that where it my input ended connors is straight talker and will be equally blunt and honest in his dealings with the lta and the cream of britain young players if they re chosen they ve got to produce he said if not someone will come and take their place there only one number one spot and it lonely up there but it got the best view in the year that has seen andrew murray emerge as britain great new hope connors rejected suggestions that the scot might be put under too much pressure too soon tim henman has whole country on his shoulder said connors don know that pressure but if you like that it can be certain push to get on to the next level someone going to have to come and take over from him henman if was andrew murray embrace that that what we play for despite the emphasis on hard work training and preparation connors does admit that the desire required of champion has to come from within the passion had don know if you can find that he admitted was also nuts say that because there was nothing better for me than to compete on the tennis court it was the most important thing in the world for me and to do that something got to be not right with you there was nothing better for me ever than to play tennis in front of people what had when played tennis is what am you have to have that you can be moulded

park after his st minute winner against wimbledon saved everton from relegation in stuart spent just over four years at goodison park making senior appearances and scoring goals before signing for sheffield united where he scored goals in appearances after signing for charlton he made appearances scoring times but recently he has been battling back problem and had not played for the londoners for three months before heading to norwich newcastle gloucester newcastle centre mathew tait answered his critics as he scored one try and made another but he could not stop gloucester grabbing draw the falcons were down at the break before tait recently axed by england after just one six nations outing inspired his side to lead last gasp touchdown from luke narraway pulled the visitors level but gloucester missed out on victory when henry paul fluffed the conversion and seti kiole was denied late try newcastle had couple of chances at the start of the second half with line outs in the corner but they failed to make them count until joe shaw found dave walder who released mark mayerholfer in his own the former all black broke clear and popped the ball up for tait on halfway he chipped ahead for michael stephenson to scorch through for the try which walder converted to give newcastle lifeline they grabbed it with both hands mayerhofler breaking through and tait making brilliant early run to cut inside and race to score walder converted to make it before he was just wide with penalty in the th minute mayerhofler then scythed through the middle for try after hall charlton popped the ball up and walder conversion took newcastle ahead with three minutes of normal time left narraway was driven over for try in the corner which levelled the scores at henry missed the

brazil he arrived at the vasco da gama club with considerable prestige which he failed to live up to he left an impression but not for reasons he would have wanted the only thing of note he did was to throw the ball back when it went out of play even today gandula is the term used in brazil for ballboy brazilians delighted in the failure of gandulla then and many will delight now if history is repeated another boca juniors player is coming to brazil the new maradona carlos tevez is joining corinthians for nearly in strong candidate for the strangest move of the year corinthians or the london based company who have just entered into partnership with them appear to have paid well above the odds for tevez it is particularly strange as until last week tevez was not even an especially big name in brazil where the argentine championship is not shown presumably there is some financial logic behind the move what is harder to work out is why tevez should be interested in heading north rather than across the atlantic argentina brightest new star hit top form in august as he spearheaded the charge towards the olympic gold medal but the subsequent months have not been easy for tevez boca re signed martin palermo forcing tevez to vacate his favoured centre forward role and off the pitch he gave the press plenty to report atletico madrid gave up on him after declaring his private life to be disorganized hounded by the press tevez grew tired of his life in buenos aires so now he says that he is heading for corinthians in search of tranquillity anyone acquainted with the city of paulo will relish the nonsense of this declaration brazil biggest city is sprawling ugly restless metropolis once it shared with buenos aires the same melancholy air of city of italian immigrants but that world now lies buried under skyscrapers the most turbulent place in this frenetic city is sport club corinthians it is the most passionately supported club in brazil pel scored reams of goals against them reasoning that unless he did something special the corinthians fans were capable of winning the game on their own that passion can also be turned against the team especially nowadays when the level of urban violence gives hysterical edge to life in brazil big cities corinthians fans have invaded the dressing room or ambushed the team coach to attack the players tevez then can kiss tranquillity goodbye he can also say farewell to the copa libertadores south america champions league corinthians have not qualified indeed he will have long wait for worthwhile match next year brazilian championship only gets underway at the end of april until then he will have to make do with the foolish paulo state championship an appalling waste of his talent there will be matches in small towns on poor pitches with plenty of defenders keen to kick him all the way back to argentina like so many of the top south american players tevez has the gift of being able to surprise to feint

take care of them all but broke him four times and he only broke me once felt that was the key to get up in the set early hewitt played down his defeat and insisted he is focused solely on the australian open which starts on january when you ve been number one in the world for couple of years and won couple of slams you look at the big picture and what motivates you said hewitt that the grand slams and melbourne as big for me as any of the four even if don win sydney next week it no big deal collins appeals against drugs ban sprinter michelle collins has lodged an appeal against her

drugs to elite athletes corry backs skipper robinson england forward martin corry says jason robinson is the right man to lead the national team back to winning ways after losses to wales and france critics have started to wonder whether robinson can captain from full back but corry has backed robinson who was given the role after the injury to fly half jonny wilkinson ahead of this weekend trip to ireland jason is doing tremendous job every week my respect for him goes up corry told bbc radio five live he is an inspirational captain when he talks with the squad he talks with lot of sense the players have lot of respect for him it an honour to be in the england side and an honour to play under him england are under immense pressure following their poor start to the year and victory is vital if they are to rescue their six nations campaign but corry insists england are in the right frame of mind for the contest there is apprehension going into every game he added but you have to use that fear and put it into positive mindset when the whistle goes on sunday what has happened in the past does not count for anything we have not performed but if we put in performance on sunday then we can start turning results around there are lot of changes taking place with england and we are at the start of something we have not got off to the greatest of starts but you need to experience the bad the before you can fully appreciate the good trip to lansdowne road is daunting at any time especially against an ireland side that are flying high after two impressive wins they are the form team of the tournament and are tipped to claim their first grand slam since but corry is relishing the prospect of taking on the irish in their own backyard they are full of confidence and are playing great team game he said the forwards are creating great platform and they have explosive runners out wide if you look at the team on paper they have stars from one to it huge task but it is great opportunity for us lansdowne road is tremendous venue to play in and we have to use it to our advantage veteran martinez wins thai title conchita martinez won her first title in almost five years with victory over anna lena groenefeld at the volvo women open in pattaya thailand the year old spaniard came through for her first title since berlin in it feels really good said martinez who is playing her last season on the tour to come through like that in an important match feels good it been nearly five years and didn think could do it groenefeld was the more powerful player but could not match her opponent relentless accuracy it was my first final new experience said the german think she played good match tough match but tried to stay in there think the whole week was good for me robben and cole earn chelsea win cheslea salvaged win against battling portsmouth side just as it looked like the premiership leaders would have to settle for point arjen robben curled in late deflected left footed shot from the right side of pompey box to break the home side brave resistance chelsea had been continually frustrated but joe cole added second with yard shot in injury time nigel quashie had pompey best chance when his effort was tipped over the fratton park crowd were in good voice as usual and even though portsmouth more than held their own chelsea still managed to carve out two early chances striker didier drogba snapped in an angled shot to force home keeper shaka hislop into smart save while an unmarked frank lampard had strike blocked by arjan de zeeuw but pompey chased harried and unsettled chelsea side as the south coast side started to gain the upper hand and almost took the lead through quashie the midfielder struck swerving long range shot which keeper petr cech tipped over at full stretch pompey stretched arsenal to the limit recently and were providing similarly tough obstacle to overcome for chelsea team struggling to exert any pressure velimir zajec players stood firm as the visitors came out in lively fashion after the break but just as they took stranglehold of the match the visitors launched counter attack drogba spun to get sight of goal and struck fierce shot which rocked keeper hislop back as he blocked before arjan de zeeuw cleared the danger the home side were also left breathing sigh of relief when glen johnson header fell to gudjohnsen who had his back to goal in crowded pompey goalmouth the icelandic forward tried to acrobatically direct the ball into goal but put his effort over but just like against arsenal portsmouth let in late goal when robben shot took deflection off matthew taylor on its way past wrong footed hislop and cole put bit of gloss on hard fought win when he put low shot into the bottom of the pompey net hislop

stadium and people were slightly injured safin cool on wimbledon newly crowned australian open champion marat safin has ruled out any chance of winning wimbledon in the future after losing in round one last year safin said he had given up on wimbledon and winning his second grand slam title has not changed his mind ll play but with no expectations feel like can waste my time my energy on that surface he said some people they cannot play on clay some people they cannot play on hard court me can play on grass however safin is hopeful that winning the australian open will give him the belief he needs to win more grand slam titles it relief for me two grand slams it already something but with this one worked really hard for it he said basically would love to win couple more think have chance if continue this way if coach peter lundgren will stick around with me and wants to work with me for bit longer think can make it the year old shocked pete sampras in the us open final to win his first major title but then lost in two australian open finals safin admitted he had begun to doubt whether he would win another grand slam didn expect that to win the us open it was against sampras wasn the favourite so had no pressure whatsoever he said after the first final that didn win against thomas johansson in couldn see myself winning the grand slams anymore was once in the semi finals of the french open but didn believe can win it just couldn handle the pressure you need to believe in yourself and didn and after losing the first set to lleyton hewitt in sunday final safin said he began to doubt himself again am playing against hewitt at least you have to have the opportunity to win it at least have chance he said it like you go there and you lose first set then you start to think this is not my day the way playing is ridiculous but then you start to really be little bit more selfish and try to find way out of there and found it was like really much was much happier than in that for sure because get over it bristol city milton keynes leroy lita took his goal tally to for the season as his double earned city an ldv vans trophy win the striker finished off

the international association of athletics federations iaaf council held conference call on tuesday and are set to announce their decision kenteris and thanou could be suspended for up to two years the duo withdrew from the olympics after missing test but claimed they had suffered motorcycle crash the greek authorities have also brought criminal charges against the sprinters for avoiding drugs test and faking an accident their former coach christos tzekos is also facing charges and all three are awaiting trial date however the iaaf will determine the sprinters future on the track after carefully considering all the evidence the sport ruling body is expected to direct the greek federation in what action it should take against the sprinters kenteris and thanou can appeal against any decision at the court of arbitration for sport the sprinters both sent written explanations to the iaaf which have been taken into account the iaaf sent an official warning to the sprinters and coach tzekos after they were discovered training in qatar rather than in crete where they had said they would be but kenteris and thanou then went on to skip tests in tel aviv and chicago when they decided to fly back to greece early just before the olympics the pair dramatically missed another test in athens before withdrawing from the games kenteris won gold in the at the sydney olympics in where thanou won silver in the france wales sat stade de france paris saturday february gmt bbc radio lw and this website france may have beaten scotland and england but they were tedious and uninspired throughout both matches wales on the other hand have played some fine rugby and have made their best start since they last won the title in they also have good record at the stade de france having won their first two games there in and wales have made two changes from the team that thrashed italy in rome kevin morgan takes over from his injured newport gwent dragons colleague hal luscombe on the right wing in the pack neath swansea ospreys forward ryan jones bas been brought on the blind side flank to beef up the wales back row in place of jonathan thomas wales coach mike ruddock is determined that his team will not go into their shells after their promising start to the championship graham henry former wales coach said couple of years ago that we should be bold when going to france and he was proved right said ruddock that is great way to approach the game and something we will further endorse with the players this week despite their stuttering displays in their first two games defending champions france are also unbeaten under pressure coach bernard laporte has made four changes with yannick nyanga the debutant julien laharrague aurelien rougerie and yannick jauzion coming into the side france have been criticised for the absence of traditional french flair as they have ground their way to victory so far this year but captain fabien pelous sees hope on the

wayward kicking played big part in england defeat to france hodgson failed to convert three penalties and also missed relatively easy drop goal attempt which would have given england late win very disappointed with the result and with my myself hodgson said it is very hard to take but it something will have to get through and come back stronger my training been good but it just didn happen hodgson revealed that olly barkley had taken three penalties because they were out of my range but the centre could not convert his opportunities either particularly the drop goal late on it wasn good strike he added felt as soon as it hit my boot it had missed it very disappointing but must recover andy robinson said he would keep working on the kicking with his squad however the england coach added that he would take some positives from the defeat we went out to play and played some very good rugby and what have france done he said they won the game from kicking penalties from our line it very frustrating the lads showed lot of ambition in the first half they went out to sustain it in the second but couldn build on it we took the ball into contact and you know when you do that it is lottery whether the referee is going to give the penalty to your side or the other side we have lost game we should have won there is fine line between winning and losing and for the second week we ve been on the wrong side of that line and it hurts england went in at half time with lead but they failed to score in the second half and dimitri yachvili slotted over four penalties as france overhauled the deficit england skipper jason robinson admitted his side failed to cope with france improved second half display we controlled the game in the first half but we knew that they would come out and try everything after half time he said we made lot of mistakes in the second half and they punished us they took their chances when they came it very disappointing last week we lost by two points now one point england coach faces rap after row england coach andy robinson is facing disciplinary action after criticising referee jonathan kaplan in his side six nations defeat to ireland the rugby football union rfu will investigate robinson after deciding not to lodge complaint against kaplan robinson may even have to apologise for his comments in order to avoid sanction from the international rugby board robinson had said he was livid about kaplan decisions on saturday to disallow two england tries the england coach went on to claim that only one side was refereed after reviewing tapes of the match the rfu decided not to formally complain to the irb over the standard of kaplan refereeing instead the rfu said in statement they would set out any concerns the england team management may have in confidential manner an irb spokesman said on the matter we take all breaches of the code very seriously should the rfu resolve the issue to our satisfaction as happened last month when the scotland coach matt williams apologised for remarks made it would be the end of the matter kaplan has vigorously defended his performance in england defeat at landsdowne road and admitted he was very disappointed with robinson remarks and the south african has been appointed to take charge of scotland match against wales on march the rfu recently fined northampton coach budge pountney and imposed six week ban for his criticism of referee steve lander after premiership match blues slam blackburn over savage birmingham have confirmed blackburn made bid for robbie savage but managing director karen brady has called it derisory rovers have reportedly offered up front for the wales star with the fee rising to but brady told the sun the bid was waste of fax paper and my time she added the way things are going all this could affect the relationship between the clubs they ve got into robbie head but he not for sale savage future at birmingham has been the source of speculation for several weeks with some fans criticising his performances for the club earlier in the season however good displays against west brom and aston villa have impressed blues fans the crowd gave me massive standing ovation when came off on saturday which was nice he said it was fantastic even though was criticised by number of them in recent weeks and on saturday it showed how much mean to them it not for me to say about transfer rumours it between the two clubs haven created the speculation myself haven phoned every national newspaper saying blackburn are trying to buy me it not up to me birmingham manager steve bruce insists he does not want to sell savage lot is said and written about sav but he has been terrific for birmingham city the last two and half years he said the fans love him because he epitomises them he works hard they like people like that and there are not many like him and why the hell should sell him to someone else am not interested santini resigns as spurs manager tottenham manager jacques santini has resigned for personal reasons the former france manager moved to white hart lane this summer but now wants to return to france santini said my time at tottenham has been memorable and it is with deep regret that take my leave wish the club and the supporters all the best private issues in my personal life have arisen which caused my decision very much hope that the wonderful fans will respect my decision he added should like to thank sporting director frank arnesen and chairman daniel levy for their understanding assistant coach martin jol has been put in temporary charge and will take care of team affairs for saturday premiership match against charlton arnesen said the club were sad to see santini go we are obviously disappointed that jacques is leaving us we fully respect his decision can assure you that the club will act swiftly to minimise the impact of jacques departure our priority is to ensure that this season performance remains unaffected by this move shall make further statement on monday clarifying our position we wish jacques well finnan says irish can win group steve finnan believes the republic of ireland can qualify directly for the world cup finals after saturday superb display in the draw in paris ireland face minnows the faroe islands in dublin on wednesday the versatile finnan who starred against the french is confident the group is ireland for the taking there is chance for us now to go on win our home games and why not win the group even though it tough one said the liverpool player switzerland ireland france and israel are all now tied on five points from three matches although the republic look to have slight edge after claiming away draws in basel and paris in basel we did not play great football but when you to go to these places the other teams are going to have the majority of the game in paris we looked good throughout the team and point was the least we deserved because we had number of chances looking back we had an opportunity to get the three points but we are happy with point and that will give us confidence going into wednesday game on paper we have got the toughest matches out of the way and we have set standards for ourselves automatic qualification is there it would certainly be good to avoid play off but on the back of couple of good results don see why we can win the group manager brian kerr was keen to mention the contribution of stephen carr and finnan on ireland right flank at the stade de france finnan normal position is right back but he looked assured in more advanced position against the french as play on the right for my club and being natural right back it was something he kerr looked at because france play strongly down the left hand side so was happy to play and stephen carr and enjoyed the game particularly as the defence and midfield held together well and nullified their attacks liverpool pledge to keep gerrard liverpool chief executive rick parry insists the club will never sell steven gerrard amid reports chelsea will renew their bid to lure him from anfield gerrard reiterated his desire to win trophies with the reds after his superb champions league winner on wednesday and parry has moved to scotch claims that chelsea could launch bid there is no chance of stevie going in january said parry that just won happen our intention is that we will never let him go gerrard scored spectacular late goal to give liverpool win over olympiakos and book their place in the knockout stages of course he is ambitious but so are we parry added we firmly believe that if we can satisfy his ambition he will remain liverpool player we have an open and straightforward relationship we both know where we stand and that played big part in his decision to stay last summer if he was not so committed to liverpool he would have gone by now gerrard had said before wednesday game he would consider leaving if the club was knocked out of europe with real madrid also believed to be monitoring his situation the main point have made is want to be in liverpool side which challenges for the champions league and the title all the time he said afterwards want to be winning things with liverpool not somewhere else am fan as well and think what have said the supporters will agree with we have to build on wins like that not just settle for great win and then not progress any further my goal was one of the most important have ever scored and hope it turns out to be one of the most important for the club for long time know put lot of pressure on myself because of what said and felt needed big performance but am not going to go around telling lies about how feel reds manager rafael benitez believes gerrard can win everything he wants to without moving clubs steven can win all he wants with us and we need him he has seen that we have good team and we can do more things in the future said benitez but if we want to win more games important games we need steven in the team we need his strength the strong mentality he has and his quality think he likes and wants the responsibility of leading this team parmar ruled out of

claimed only their second ever win over south africa on an emotional day at lansdowne road gara first half try poached after quick tap penalty helped the irish to lead at half time three further gara penalties extended ireland lead to as the game entered the final quarter two percy montgomery penalties set up frantic finish but ireland held out to claim famous victory ireland began strongly and were never led but the match was tense and closely fought throughout aware of the threat posed by the south africans ireland pressed hard from the outset and played some impressive rugby while searching for breakthrough early on denis hickie thought he was in for try after delightful backline move but shane horgan pass was adjudged to have gone forward by referee paul honiss ireland continued to press and they showed their intent by opting for line out in the th minute when three straight forward points were on offer another south african infringement minute later led to ireland first points gara took quick tap penalty and charged over the opposition line for an irish try the springboks could feel hard done by as captain john smit had his back to the play when gara pounced after referee honiss had told the skipper to warn his own players after consistent infringements stung by the score the south africans almost replied with try of their own within seconds with geordan murphy ankle tap tackle denying certain try for percy montgomery however the springboks did win penalty minute later which montgomery easily slotted to cut ireland lead to ireland got out of jail when the south africans had three to one overlap near the irish line only to waste the chance after the sustained springboks pressure the irish produced an attack of their own in the th minute which culminated with gara clever drop goal to restore his side lead to five points which remained the margin at half time sustained irish pressure immediately after half time was rewarded by another gara penalty however montgomery responded quickly by slotting over superb penalty from near the right touchline to cut ireland lead to five points again montgomery then burst through the irish defence in the th minute and it took superb girvan dempsey tackle to prevent try the south africans suffered double blow in the nd minute when schalk burger was sin binned for the second week in row after killing the ball and gara punished the transgression by notching another penalty in the st minute hickie was left frustrated by poor pass from girvan dempsey as chance to seal the match was wasted however late tackle on brian driscoll enabled gara to notch another penalty in the rd minute which extended ireland lead to however two montgomery penalties had ireland lead in peril again as the springboks closed to within five points with seven minutes remaining south africa produced huge effort in the closing minutes but ireland held on to claim deserved victory dempsey murphy driscoll capt

united went ahead through alan smith in the rd minute before bouba diop superb yard strike cancelled out the visitors lead in the th minute ferguson described the result as an absolute giveaway after united had earlier missed host of opportunities to finish off the encounter he said it was good performance some of the football was fantastic but we just didn finish them off in fairness it fantastic

has there been better six nations match than saturday epic in paris and can the welsh revival continue all the way to first grand slam since those are the two questions occupying not just wales supporters but rugby fans as whole after scintillating display in paris welsh legend mervyn davies member of two of three grand slam winning sides of the hailed it as one of the great performances of the past three decades martyn williams wales two try scorer on the day called it one of the most surreal games have ever played in crestfallen france coach bernard laporte simply observed there was french half and there was welsh half and what half it was for the red dragonhood transforming half time deficit into an lead within five mesmerising minutes of the second period but while that passage of play showed the swelling self belief of side prepared to back its own spirit of adventure the final quarter told us whole lot more about this welsh side that they recovered from battering in the first half hour to first stem the tide before half time then reverse it on the resumption was remarkable enough but in resisting seemingly unstoppable wave of french pressure in nail biting final five minutes wales showed not only their physical attributes but their mental resolve in international rugby any of the top seven sides can beat each other on given day but the great sides are those that win the close contests on consistent basis england suffered some infamous six nations disappointments en route to world cup glory the pain of defeat forging bonds that ultimately led to victory when it really mattered wales have some way to go before they can be remotely considered in similar light but the signs are that players previously on the receiving end are learning how to emerge on the right side of the scoreline ten of the on duty on saturday were also involved when wales were trounced in paris two years ago but since they threw off the shackles against new zealand in the world cup wales have rediscovered much of what made them great rugby nation in the first place the confidence in the squad has been building and building since the world cup and we now have young players who are becoming world class noted coach mike ruddock the likes of michael owen gethin jenkins dwayne peel and gavin henson are certainly building strong cases for inclusion on this summer lions tour to new zealand and players like stephen jones martyn williams shane williams and gareth thomas are proving it is not only the youngsters that are on an upward curve jones after his superb man of the match display observed that we are very happy camp now ruddock and thomas can take much of the credit for that ensuring the tribal and regional divisions that have often scarred welsh rugby do not extend to the national squad the joie de vivre so evident in that magical second half spell in paris also stems from style of play that first wooed supporters the world over in the if england had half the innate attacking exuberance wales have produced in this championship they would not be contemplating the debris of three consecutive defeats similarly wales have learnt that style alone does not win matches and that forward power mental toughness and good decision making under pressure are equally important so on to murrayfield where wales have not won on their last three visits while the hype in the principality will go into overdrive the players will set about the task of beating scotland only then with the visit of ireland to finish can they start thinking about emulating the hallowed players of the and writing their own names into welsh legend safin plays down wimbledon hopes newly crowned australian open champion marat safin has ruled out any chance of winning wimbledon in the future after losing in round one last year safin said he had given up on wimbledon and winning his second grand slam title has not changed his mind ll play but with no expectations feel like can waste my time my energy on that surface he said some people they cannot play on clay some people they cannot play on hard court me can play on grass however safin is hopeful that winning the australian open will give him the belief he needs to win more grand slam titles it relief for me two grand slams it already something but with this one worked really hard for it he said basically would love to win couple more think have chance if continue this way if coach peter lundgren will stick around with me and wants to work with me for bit longer think can make it the year old shocked pete sampras in the us open final to win his first major title but then lost in two australian open finals safin admitted he had begun to doubt whether he would win another grand slam didn expect that to win the us open it was against sampras wasn the favourite so had no pressure whatsoever he said after the first final that didn win against thomas johansson in couldn see myself winning the grand slams anymore was once in the semi finals of the french open but didn believe can win it just couldn handle the pressure you need to believe in yourself and didn and after losing the first set to lleyton hewitt in sunday final safin said he began to doubt himself again am playing against hewitt at least you have to have the opportunity to win it at least have chance he said it like you go there and you lose first set then you start to think this is not my day the way playing is ridiculous but then you start to really be little bit more selfish and try to find way out of there and found it was like really much was much happier than in that for sure because get over it yachvili savours france comeback france scrum half dimitri yachvili praised his team after they fought back to beat england in the six nations clash at twickenham yachvili kicked all of france points as they staged second half revival we didn play last week against scotland and we didn play in the first half against england he said but we re very proud to beat england at twickenham we were just defending in the first half and we said we had to put them under pressure we did well yachvili admitted erratic kicking from england charlie hodgson and olly barkley who missed six penalties and drop goal chance between them had been decisive know what it like with kicking when you miss some it very hard mentally but it went well for us he said france captain fabien pelous insisted his side never doubted they could secure their first win against england at twickenham since france were down at half time but pelous said no one was down at half time we were still confident we said we only had points against us which was not much the plan was to keep hold of possession and pressure england to losing their composure france coach bernard laporte accepted his side had not played well we know we have to play better to defend the title he said not happy we didn score try but we re happy because we won england france england suffered an eighth defeat in tests as scrum half dimitri yachvili booted france to victory at twickenham two converted tries from olly barkley and josh lewsey helped the world champions to half time lead but charlie hodgson and barkley missed six penalties between them while yachvili landed six for france to put the visitors in front england could have won the game with three minutes left but hodgson pushed an easy drop goal opportunity wide it was dismal defeat for england coming hard on the heels of an opening six nations loss in wales they should have put the game well beyond france reach but remarkably remained scoreless for the entire second half scrappy opening quarter saw both sides betray the lack of confidence engendered by poor opening displays against wales and scotland respectively hodgson had an early opportunity to settle english nerves but pushed straightforward penalty attempt wide but probing kick from france centre damien traille saw mark cueto penalised for holding on to the ball in the tackle yachvili giving france the lead with kick from wide out france twice turned over england ball at the breakdown early on as the home side struggled to generate forward momentum one ben kay charge apart spell of tit for tat kicking emphasised the caution on both sides until england refused possible three points to kick penalty to the corner only to botch the subsequent line out but england made the breakthrough after minutes when faltering move off the back of scrum led to the opening try jamie noon took short pass from barkley and ran good angle to plough through yann delaigue flimsy tackle before sending his centre partner through to score at the posts hodgson converted and added penalty after one of several french infringements on the floor for lead the fly half failed to dispense punishment though with scuffed attempt after france full back pepito elhorga scragged by lewsey threw the ball into touch barkley also missed two longer range efforts as the first half drew to close but by then england had scored second converted try after series of phases lock danny grewcock ran hard at the french defence and off loaded out of sylvain marconnet tackle to lewsey the industrious wing cut back in on an angle and handed off hooker sebastien bruno to sprint over after dire opening to the second half france threw on three forward replacements in an attempt to rectify the situation wing jimmy marlu having already departed injured yachvili nibbled away at the lead with third penalty after minutes and when lewis moody was twice penalised for handling in ruck and then straying offside the scrum half unerring left boot cut the deficit to two points barkley then missed his third long range effort to increase the tension and after seeing another attempt drop just short yachvili put france ahead with his sixth penalty with minutes left england sent on ben cohen and matt dawson and after barkley kick saw christophe dominici take the ball over his own line the stage was set for victory platform but even after poor scrummage hodgson had the chance to seal victory but pushed his drop goal attempt wide england threw everything at the french in the final frantic moments but the visitors held on for their first win at twickenham since robinson capt cueto noon barkley lewsey hodgson ellis rowntree thompson vickery grewcock kay worsley moody corry titterrell sheridan borthwick hazell dawson paul cohen elhorga dominici liebenberg traille marlu delaigue yachvili marconnet bruno mas pelous capt thion betsen bonnaire chabal servat milloud lamboley nyanga mignoni michalak grandclaude paddy brien new zealand mccall earns tannadice reprieve dundee united manager ian mccall has won reprieve from the sack with chairman eddie thompson calling for an end to speculation over his future it is understood that mccall would have been sacked if sheffield wednesday manager paul sturrock had been willing to return to tannadice but sturrock has distanced himself from the position we re in difficult situation we must get out of it through the efforts of current personnel said thompson ian mccall and have had long and detailed talk about number of areas including the current league position and the manner of the exit from the league cup he added however the continuing speculation is doing no one any good especially as we have several crucial games coming up the minds of the coaching staff and the players have to be on those games and those games only our season would of course improve considerably if in the next few weeks we achieved some improved league results and there is also the potential of another cup semi final subject to the draw all that matters at the present time is us all having total focus on the games ahead and positive series of results being achieved dundee united players had expressed their solidarity with mccall after their side scottish cup win over queen of the south we want the boss to stay we don want someone else coming in said jim mcintyre hopefully now he gets the chance to stay keeper tony bullock echoed mcintyre sentiments think all the boys are behind ian mccall he added at the moment it is all speculation and we have got to rise above all that and do job on the pitch on saturday sturrock insisted that he had unfinished business with wednesday who are fourth in league one ve only been here five months and don expect to be leaving very very soon he said can appreciate the rumours because ve emphasised my thoughts and ambitions to go back to dundee united can assure you the timescale is not the right one it dundee united is my team had five years there as coach six as player two years as manager once you ve done that kind of thing it the result you look for the important thing now is ve come here to do job and going to try to finish it mauresmo opens with victory in la amelie mauresmo and maria sharapova won their opening matches at the tour championships in los angeles france mauresmo routed vera zvonareva while wimbledon champion sharapova was winner over fellow russian svetlana kuznetsova american serena williams also won edging russian elena dementieva for her second victory of the event the event is split into two groups of four with the top two from each advancing to the semi finals mauresmo win was her ninth in row as she tries to overtake lindsay davenport for the number one spot mauresmo spent five weeks at number one after the us open before injury ushered davenport back in front since then feel very confident on court and my game is there want to get the ranking back but it very different than before was number one it was an obsession but now take it in relaxed way mauresmo completed her first match in the season ending championship in minutes as russia zvonareva struggled to return her serve and failed to achieve single break point she got mad little bit and played some great tennis said mauresmo who was runner up to kim clijsters in last year final zvonareva has lost both her games so far having crashed kuznetsova in the staples centre on wednesday sometimes not everything works she said it was lots of pressure maybe that is why couldn do but was fighting sharapova who lost to kuznetsova in beijing in september said in beijing she was coming off such big winning streak matches and she was unstoppable this time it was important to start off well and put some pressure on her the tournament debutant added love it here the atmosphere is great to be here where the lakers play you just feel that excitement love basketball williams admitted she is still some way off her best form but remained positive after two wins in two days it hard to go out there and get it right but fighting and hoping said williams what makes me happy is the effort had really good effort today trying to add new dimensions to my game scrum half williams rejoins bath bath have signed their former scrum half andy williams on short term deal from the neath swansea ospreys wales international williams whose contract with the welsh region was due to expire in june has agreed contract until the end of the season with martyn wood injury likely to keep him out until february bath need experienced back up to nick walshe said williams when this opportunity presented itself did not really have to think twice about it williams capped by wales against romania in should figure in the match squad for monday zurich premiership match at sale sharks he lost his ospreys starting place to new zealander jason spice and has fallen further behind in the pecking order the welsh region has two outstanding young no prospects in richie rees and rhodri wells bath director of rugby jack rowell though believes williams fits the bill perfectly he has been playing regular heineken cup and celtic league rugby and he has great affection for bath rowell told bath official website we are delighted to be able to welcome him back to the club sella wants michalak recall former france centre philippe sella believes coach bernard laporte must recall frederic michalak to give his side any chance of beating ireland sella admitted he had been impressed by current fly half yann delaigue in the rbs six nations to date but he told bbc sport michalak is the answer both now and for the future delaigue deserved his chance but the time has come to bring back michalak he does have weaknesses but has the all round game to upset ireland the year old michalak has spent much of the tournament on the bench after delaigue impressed for castres early in the season with michalak overlooked the french stuttered to narrow wins over scotland and then england before ironically playing their best rugby in the defeat to wales the wales game was amazing to watch but never did think the french could lose that game at half time said sella their only mistakes were that they didn score enough points in the first half and were little bit less focused in the second but only little bit sella however insisted the pressure had eased on the under fire laporte despite the defeat at the stade de france this season is very important for shaping team for the world cup said sella which laporte is doing very well the french get better every game it difficult though when you change team and you change your tactics as everything has to gel but he has the players and the talent to take them all the way to world cup victory as result it is important that people give him time it may not seem good now that we re not winning the grand slam but no one will care in two years time if we re world champions the majority of media criticism centred on the way in which france produced performance devoid of running rugby in their opening two games but while sella admitted he liked the more flowing style employed against wales he said the win was most important winning is all that matters he added ok the flair may not have been so good but the discipline organisation and defence was there which are all important ahead of france play what sella believes is their hardest game of the six nations against ireland in dublin on saturday march the french go into the game as clear underdogs but sella added people forget that france can still win the six nations and they ll be focused on that but ireland will be going for even more in front of their home crowd it going to be tough hamm bows out for us women football legend mia hamm has played her final game hamm who officially retired after this year athens olympics took to the field for the last time to help the us claim win over mexico hamm ends her career as the most prolific scorer male or female in international football with goals in games for the us she was twice fifa women player of the year and won the world cup in and and two olympic golds on her retirement hamm said there are mixed emotions there are things in your life that you have had to put on the back burner and you can focus more time and energy on that now have to see what is out there and not commit to everything at the beginning the friendly also saw the end of julie foudy and joy fawcett us careers hamm will now embark on new life with husband chicago cubs shortstop nomar garciaparra who was in the stands to watch her final game he has just agreed new deal with the cubs after joining them in july italy aim to rattle england italy coach john kirwan believes his side can upset england as the six nations wooden spoon battle hots up the two sides both without win meet on march at twickenham and kirwan says his side will be hoping to make the most of england current slump we have to make sure the england and france games are tough for them england have not been having the best of championships that is big one for us and them and am sure my players will rise to the occasion he said but kirwan admits that lot of hard work will be needed with his kickers before the trip to london roland de marigny and luciano orquera had miserable time with the boot in the dire defeat to scotland as chris paterson stole the show to give the hosts much needed victory kirwan said the kicking was the decisive factor in scotland which cost us and it could go down to the kicking again next time but have lot of confidence in my players and am positive we can put everything together against england england meanwhile are licking their wounds and rueing what might have been had two decisions from referee jonathan kaplan not gone against them in the second half in dublin first mark cueto was judged offside as he chased fly half charlie hodgson kick and then kaplan opted not to call upon video evidence to see if josh lewsey had touched down after being driven over ireland line but centre jamie noon believes the side at least showed better form than their previous two defeats we definitely improved against an in form irish side he said we went to dublin quietly confident that we would be able to compete and think we showed that we have got to make sure we now take the form and positives into the italy game we are under no illusions that it is going to be easy but we definitely need win england have now equalled an year low of four successive championship defeats including france in paris last season and have lost four in row under andy robinson his predecessor sir clive woodward began his seven year reign with three defeats and two draws merritt close to indoor mark teenager lashawn merritt ran the third fastest indoor of all time at the fayetteville invitational meeting the world junior champion clocked seconds to finish well clear of fellow american bershawn jackson in arkansas only michael johnson has gone quicker setting the world record of secs in and running secs in kenyan bernard lagat missed out on the world record by secs as he ran the third quickest indoor mile ever to beat canada nate brannen by almost secs the olympic silver medallist time of three minutes secs was inferior only to the world record of moroccan hicham el guerrouj and former world record holder eamonn coghlan of ireland lagat was on course to break el guerrouj record through but could not maintain the pace over the final ireland continued his excellent form by winning tight in cragg who recently defeated olympic champion kenenisa bekele in boston held off bekele ethiopian colleague markos geneti by only secs to secure his victory mark carroll who will join cragg in the european indoor championships next month finished solid third in olympic gold medallist of jamaica ran the fastest women in the world this year as she equalled her personal best of secs world indoor hurdles champion also won improving his season leading time to secs wales coach elated with win mike ruddock paid tribute to his wales side after they came from down to beat france in the six nations after going two tries down in minutes we had to show character said the national team coach didn have to tell them anything at half time because those players have stared down the barrel of gun before they decided they didn want to do that again and came out fighting it was great team effort and we showed great character to come back man of the match stephen jones who kicked three penalties drop goal and conversion was ecstatic following after the win at stade de france it just special moment two years ago we didn win single game in the six nations but we re very happy camp now he said we worked hard as squad and proud welshman we ve got hard matches to come so we re just happy with the start double try scorer martyn williams was keen not to talk about possible grand slam for wales we ve got more self belief these days two or three years ago we might have collapsed after going behind so early there no mention of grand slam among the players we ve got tough game against scotland at murrayfield they could bring us crashing down to earth verdict delay for greek sprinters greek athletics governing body has postponed by two weeks the judgement on sprinters costas kenteris and katerina thanou for missing doping tests the pair are facing

in hospital following the final hearing in late january the athletes sounded confident they would be acquitted am confident and optimistic thanou had said at the time we presented new evidence to the committee that they were not aware of it was not clear what this new evidence was hantuchova in dubai last eight daniela hantuchova moved into the quarter finals of the dubai open after beating elene likhotseva of russia and now faces serena williams australian open champion williams survived an early scare to beat russia elena bovina world number one lindsay davenport and anastasia myskina also

pits wild card sania mirza of india against jelena jankovic of serbia and montenegro who both won on tuesday before her meeting with martinez davenport believes there is some room for improvement in her game started well and finished well but played some so so games in the middle she said williams was also far from content don know what was doing there she said it was really windy and hadn played in the wind all my shots were going out of here but hantuchova is in upbeat mood ahead of her clash with the younger williams sister who was handed first round bye feel have an advantage over serena because have already played two matches on these courts she said it is difficult court to play on very fast and sometimes you feel you have no control over the ball mourinho takes swipe at arsenal chelsea boss jose mourinho has attempted to pile the pressure on title rivals arsenal ahead of the gunners facing newcastle on wednesday arsenal will play the magpies day after chelsea beat portsmouth during busy festive programme and mourinho said they always seem to have two or three days rest in which to recover perhaps it something to do with the television schedule all my players are tired especially john terry chelsea boss jose mourinho admitted his side were lucky to win at fratton park but is still unhappy with the amount of games in such short space of time during this time of year he added we have had to play two matches in three days which is foreign to many of my players and although understand the traditions of football here at this time of year it is not good for your health to do it you can sit back and smoke cigars one after another and it is good life but it is not actually good for you playing so many games is certainly not healthy especially for teams who still have european commitment bosvelt optimistic over new deal manchester city paul bosvelt will find out within month whether he is to be offered new one year deal the year old dutch midfielder is out of contract in the summer and although his age may count against him he feels he can play on for another season told the club would like to stay for one more year they promised me an answer within the next month so am waiting to see he said the main concern is my age but think have proved am fit enough bosvelt joined city from feyenoord in and at first he struggled to adapt to life in england but his professionalism and dedication impressed manager kevin keegan he realised the pace of the game was faster than anything he was used to but he drove himself back into the team he is an unsung hero said keegan sullivan keeps his powder dry when you are gunning for glory and ultimate success keeping the gunpowder dry is essential ireland coach eddie sullivan appears to have done that quite successfully in the run up to this season six nations championship he decreed after the world cup that players should have decent conditioning period during the year that became reality at the end of last summer with week period at the start of the this season it may have annoyed his scottish and in particularly welsh cousins who huffed and puffed at the disrespect apparently shown to the celtic league we will say nothing of mike ruddock poaching eight of the dragons side that faced leinster on sunday but like sullivan he was well within his rights particularly when you are talking about the national side and pride that goes along with it the irfu has thrown their weight behind sullivan who must be glad that in the main there is centrally controlled contracts bar keith gleeson who is just returning from broken leg everyone of sullivan squad is fit fresh and standing at the oche ready to launch this season campaign but doubt whether sullivan is going to gloat about the handling of his players he is not that sort of person however he may look at the overworked and injury hit england wales and france squads whose players have been overworked and then pat himself on the back for his foresight but there is still the question of turning up and transferring that freshness into positive results when the referee signals the start of the game already ireland are being earmarked as hot favourites in many quarters to go the whole hog this season first grand slam since karl mullen led the team to clean sweep in with england and france visiting lansdowne road for the last time before the old darling is pulled down everything looks perfectly placed but in the days of yore that frightened the life out of any irishman under the burden of great expectations ireland have crumpled take the triple crown winning side of under mick doyle they were expected to up the ante further for grand slam only the second in ireland history what happened in whitewashed you see ireland in any sport love to be downsized then they can go out and prove point to the contrary it is the nature of the beast but sullivan side are very capable of proving salient point this season after their first triple crown for years they can live up to their success and take further step up the ladder sullivan has kept faith and displayed loyalty to his players and they have repaid him in spades and there is more to come he has some old dogs in his squad but he will come to this season championship with different box of tricks and new verve to succeed ireland can indeed succeed but just whisper it hodges announces rugby retirement scarlets and usa eagles forward dave hodges has ended his playing career to pursue coaching role in the states the year old who has caps was llanelli player of the season in but has battled injury for the last two of his seven years at stradey he tore pectoral muscle against the ospreys on boxing day an injury that would have kept him out for the season realising would be unable to play this season the club and agreed to end my contract early said hodges it allows me to move back to the us and pursue opportunities there and allows the scarlets to look to the next generation the scarlets have begun to rebuild their squad for next season after disappointing heineken cup campaign with plenty more signings and departures expected in the coming weeks scarlets chief executive stuart gallacher confirmed that of the current squad would be out of contract in the summer we have deliberate policy whereby around half the squad are coming out of contract and they know they won all be re signed it chance to invigorate the squad he said positive about the future of the scarlets both on and off the field gallacher was keen to pay tribute to the role back five forward hodges has played at stradey park though david has been highly influential member of our squad for seven years said gallacher he is real professional and we thank him for the part he has played in our success am sure he has an enormous contribution to make to the development of rugby in the us and we wish him and his family well hodges described his years at stradey as the best time of my life newry to fight cup exit in courts newry city are expected to discuss legal avenues on friday regarding overturning their ejection from the nationwide irish cup the ifa upheld its original decision to throw newry out of the cup following the andy crawford registration row law firm will put case forward for newry fc and see what the legal implications of all this is are said newry boss roy mccreadie this is big issue now that we have an appeal pending on wednesday fresh ifa hearing into crawford registration saga ruled that last week original verdict had been correct it meant that bangor beaten by newry on the field will take on portadown in the sixth round newry had claimed they had uncovered fresh evidence in respect of the dates relating to the registration but mccreadie is not further annoyed that full details of wednesday meeting was not relayed to the club even to this day we have as much information about what happened during the meeting on wednesday as that told to the media we are being kept in the dark mccreadie told the news letter we want an explanation there is no good sending us the same fax message the press people received it real sad case if we are not back in the irish cup after our appeal and guided by our legal advise we will seek to lodge an injunction in the courts to stop bangor playing portadown mourinho expects fight to finish chelsea manager jose mourinho expects the champions league clash with barcelona to be fight to the finish mourinho is relishing the first leg of the tie against his former club in the last in the nou camp he said wouldn be surprised if nothing had been decided by the last minute of the return leg and the match had to go into extra time have to defend what is mine and the champions league is mine at the moment the last manager to have won it mourinho never coached barcelona assisting both sir bobby robson and louis van gaal but he is not envious insisting don have to be jealous about barcelona because they have years of history and have won the european cup once have been managing for five years and have the same amount of champions league trophies to my name barcelona star ronaldinho admitted think that it is going to be difficult match for us because chelsea have good team full of big stars have seen chelsea few times on television tactically they are very good and they are very strong on the counter attack they pressure very well and keep possession of the ball so it will be important that we play our own game believe they are the two strongest teams in europe nevertheless barcelona are accustomed to playing big games at the nou camp where they have to face the likes of real madrid each season it is special game the atmosphere in the city changes there are lots of journalists but inside the dressing room there is not lot of difference ronaldinho added we are only thinking of winning the match with all respect to the opposition connell rejects lions rumours ireland and munster lock paul connell has dismissed media reports linking him to the captaincy of the lions tour to new zealand this summer connell is rumoured to be among the front runners for the job but says he is totally focused on sunday six nations crunch clash with england honestly don think about these reports he told bbc sport the lions thing is all speculation and newspaper talk nothing more just ignore it and get on with my job he added the only thing that annoys me after reading some reports is what the opposition locks think can just imagine them saying going to show this guy what what about second row play that the one thing that makes me cringe connell who made try scoring international debut against wales two years ago is enjoying his meteoric rise into rugby shop window but refuses to be drawn on the lions have spoken to sir clive woodward few times but not for very long certainly nothing about summer holidays he joked he also said he remains wary of wounded england abilities coming into sunday game after two straight defeats dismissing predictions of certain irish victory it very dangerous to think that this england team has so much experience and skill you do not become bad team overnight they have two world class game breakers in josh lewsey and jason robinson while charlie hodgson is just ready to click into place he insisted ireland will not make the mistake of being over confident that not going to happen in our squad no ireland team lining up to play england will ever fall into that trap he said every time we play england we know what big task it is look at what they did to us two years ago remember that game all too well and it was not good feeling came on as replacement and we were losing and ended up getting hammered so know what can happen when england come to dublin they could so easily have been coming to dublin with two wins and staring grand slam in the face as well dunne keen to commit to man city richard dunne is ready to commit his long term future to manchester city after turning his career around he was once threatened with the sack by city boss kevin keegan but has since responded with impressive performances prompting interest from other clubs early talks have taken place and the defender said hopefully something will be sorted out as soon as possible definitely want to stay at city because have really improved as player here newcastle boss graeme souness is said to have been impressed enough by dunne turnaround in form to be ready to make bid for the big stopper in the january transfer window but the year old dubliner underlined his intention to stay at eastlands he added it nice to be linked with top clubs but the important thing is this one and what we do really enjoy it at city and want to keep that going keegan is expected to be told there will be no funds to bring in fresh faces in january dunne professionalism was famously questioned by keegan who ordered the defender home after he allegedly turned up for training in dishevelled state but dunne is keen to put that period of his life behind him and said ve grown up lot and the manager sees me as one of the most experienced players in the squad ve played more games than any other outfield players this season so can be regarded as being kid any more have to use that as added pressure to perform and apart from the games at newcastle and middlesbrough defensively we ve done quite well keegan is set for another boost when goalkeeper nicky weaver makes his long awaited return in reserve game at blackburn on tuesday former england under keeper weaver has missed nearly three full seasons with succession of knee injuries which eventually needed pioneering transplant surgery earlier this year wenger signs new deal arsenal manager arsene

their last matches ireland coach eddie sullivan says his side should not underestimate the visitors had they kicked their points they would have beaten france and that would have created different landscape for sunday he said this is england we are talking about they have depth of talent and very good record against ireland they will target victory in dublin as the turning point in their six nations the differences between the sides is also highlighted in the team selections for the dublin encounter ireland despite having gordon arcy still out injured have been boosted by the return of star skipper brian driscoll who missed the scotland game with hamstring injury the knowledge that the england game was coming up really helped during rehabilitation he said the will to play in this game was enormous it doesn get much bigger than england at home as well as entering the tournament without players like jonny wilkinson mike tindall and richard hill england have now lost two

mcclaren hails boro uefa spirit middlesbrough boss steve mcclaren has praised the way his side have got to grips with european football after the uefa cup win against lazio boro who are playing in europe for the first time in their year history are top of group with maximum points think we have taken to europe really well said mcclaren we got about lazio didn let them settle or play and in possession we controlled it and looked threatening every time we went forward before the match mcclaren had said that win over the italian giants would put boro firmly on the european footballing map and after they did just that he said it was perfect european night for the team to give the fans performance like that was the icing on the cake there have been many good performances but this was something special you can see that the experience we have in the squad is showing to win in europe you need to defend well and we have done that because we have conceded only one goal in four games we can also score goals and again that is something you can see from the performances we have had so we have good balance mcclaren only criticism of his side was that their dominance should have been resulted in more goals it should have been more convincing said mcclaren but had watched lazio in recent weeks and saw them score late equaliser against inter milan on saturday so knew we needed second goal no matter what anybody says lazio are favourites to win this competition middlesbrough forward boudewijn zenden said he did not expect such comfortable match after he scored both goals we didn expect it to be that one sided said zenden we did quite well in the first half we pressured them and they didn cope with that think we played quite well and it was very good game especially in the first half the holland international said boro are confident of progressing in the competition after winning their first two group games we ve got very good feeling there is good spirit all the lads work hard for each other and it squad of friendly players which think you can see on the pitch he added benitez to launch morientes bid liverpool may launch an january bid for long time target fernando morientes according to reports the real madrid striker has been linked with move to anfield since the summer and is currently behind raul ronaldo and michael owen at the bernabeu liverpool boss rafael benitez is keen to bolster his forward options with djibril cisse out until next season if there is an attractive propostition it could be would be keen to leave admitted the year old morientes he added unfortunately not in control of the situation under contract to real and they will make any decisions the fee could put liverpool off prospective deal but real are keen to net the cash as they are reported to be preparing massive summer bid for inter milan striker adriano the reds are currently sixth in the premiership points behind leaders chelsea wenger dejected as arsenal slump arsenal manager arsene wenger claimed their display in the defeat against bayern munich was our worst peformance in the champions league kolo toure late goal gives the gunners hope for the second leg but wenger said the only positive is that we are still in the tie the players are really down in the dressing room feel we really turned in bad performance at we faced real struggle but at least gives us chance goalscorer toure was also at fault for two goals and wenger said we need to help toure rebuild his confidence as he is low at the moment wenger also tried to stay upbeat himself adding but there is enough time for crying could cry maybe it would be easier but life goes on in this job you have good and bad nights this was bad night but still have confidence in the quality of my players as well as their spirit and desire but wenger bayern counterpart felix magath was in no mood to celebrate either he said am far from happy despite the win my players failed to try and score fourth to kill the tie and then conceded the late goal arsenal are fully capable of scoring several goals against us on their own turf arsenal keeper jens lehmann whose personal rivalry with bayern goalkeeper oliver kahn was not helped by the result said do blame myself for the third goal as goalkeeper always blame myself just know the goals were very easy against us in my time here we have never conceded three easy goals like that but sometimes it happens it would have been impossible to go through at but with the goal we have chances everything is now possible johansson takes adelaide victory second seed joachim johansson won his second career title with win over taylor dent at the australian hardcourt championships in adelaide the swede was made to graft american dent surviving three break points in the fifth game of the match but johansson got the breakthrough with sublime backhand return winner and won the second set with more ease his first tournament win was at memphis in helping him leap from th in the world rankings to number afterwards dent said he rated us open semi finalist johansson as top contender at the australian open which starts on january believe men tennis is all about holding serve and if he playing like that on his own serve don see how guys are going to break him said dent johansson was more restrained in his assessment have to improve my serve if going to go all the way in melbourne highbury tunnel players in clear the football association has said it will not be bringing charges over the tunnel incident prior to the arsenal and

admitted that he had not enjoyed the match which was punctuated by fouls and the sending off of mikael silvestre for head butting freddie ljungberg thought it was horrible game in the first half and it was not much better in the second he said there is no way that should have happened in football match after the match keane accused vieira of starting the row patrick vieira is ft in and having go at gary neville so said have go at me he said if he wants to intimidate our players and thinks that gary neville is an easy target not having it manchester united manager sir alex ferguson added

worlds greene crossed the line just seconds behind gatlin who won in seconds in one of the closest and fastest sprints of all time but greene believes he lost the race and his title in the semi finals in my semi final race should have won the race but was conserving energy that when francis obikwelu came up and took third because didn know he was there believe that what put me in lane seven in the final and while was in lane seven couldn feel anything in the race just felt like was running all alone believe if was in the middle of the race would have been able to react to people that came ahead

on wednesday the british number one will next play roger federer at the australian open warm up event on friday the world number one beat gaston gaudio before andre agassi saw off chilean olympic gold medalist nicolas massu andy roddick beat ivan ljubicic who replaced paradorn srichaphan henman made an impressive start to the year only faltering against nalbandian when serving for the match at but the briton regained his composure to win the next two games for only his second win in six matches against the argentine it great start to the year just what was looking for henman told his website over the years ve found david very difficult to play against he returns serve very well and he deceptively effective from the baseline so sometimes it can be difficult to execute my gameplan well enough against him to get the right result beating somebody of his stature is always good for the confidence and it bodes well at the beginning of the year henman also revealed the extent of the back problems he suffered in the off season not the most flexible and at the end of the year was pretty exhausted and wanted to have couple of weeks where didn do anything said henman when started training again it really really seized up as much as enjoyed the two weeks off don think it so productive federer dropped tight first set against french open champion gaudio but was content with his game it was about getting used to the surface he said the conditions are much quicker than doha my timing was ok but could have served better all in all happy with the match and won it that good sign now have day off and hopefully play better the next match agassi was delighted with victory over massu in his first match for over two months felt pretty good said the american liked the way the match played out and maybe excluding few second serve returns felt like was doing most things pretty darn well for the first match henry tipped for fifa award fifa president sepp blatter hopes arsenal thierry

global organisation for professional players hewitt fights back to reach final lleyton hewitt kept his dream of an australian open title alive with four set win over andy roddick in friday second semi final the home favourite will face marat safin in sunday final after coming through hewitt fought back from set down and trailed in both tie breaks but would not be denied thrilling the melbourne crowd with typically battling effort he is aiming to be the first australian winner since mark edmondson in hewitt is the first australian to make the final since pat cash lost to mats wilander in but faces huge challenge against safin the conqueror of roger federer after needing five sets in his last two matches there was reason to think hewitt might struggle for fitness he certainly made sluggish start dropping his opening service game and roddick dominated with his huge serve as he took the first set after tense games in the second the key moment came when hewitt raised his game in the tie break to overturn an early mini break that energised the crowd but roddick was not finished and raced clear in the crucial third before hewitt pegged him back and forced another tie break again roddick broke first and again hewitt fought back taking the lead with superb backhand pass the australian was not to be denied and disheartened roddick made little impact in the fourth set as hewitt raced to victory sending the melbourne crowd wild and ensuring the final will be huge occasion it awesome said hewitt started preparing for this tournament nine months ago ve done lot of hard yards to get here ve always said do anything to get in the first night final at the australian open now ve got my chance roddick was furious with himself for failing to take advantage of leads in both tie breaks usually pretty money in those said roddick either one of those would have given me distinct advantage mad felt was in there with shot he put himself in position to win big points donated little more than would have wanted and the american played down the influence of one spectator who appeared to contribute to double fault by shouting during rodick service action it just took one jackass to shout out said roddick adding that the crowd overall was very respectful campbell rescues arsenal sol campbell proved to be an unlikely match winner to earn arsenal hard fought win at portsmouth the england defender lashed home yard shot for his first goal in months to take arsenal back into second spot five points behind chelsea but before campbell scored the best two chances of the game fell to pompey striker ricardo fuller in the first half he blasted wide when clear and his control let him down in the second half when well placed portsmouth got plenty of bodies behind the ball to deny arsenal space in the early stages but their marking was slack at corner and patrick vieira should have done better when the ball fell to him yards out mistake by arjan de zeeuw let thierry henry in behind the pompey defence on minutes but as he bore down on goal linvoy primus got in saving tackle with just fuller as an out and out striker portsmouth shape made life difficult for arsenal but delightful touch by robin van persie gave henry sight of goal although the angle was too tight for his shot to trouble jamie ashdown ashdown caused hearts to flutter on minutes when he missed his punch at corner and kolo toure headed just wide and as arsenal began to press van persie blasted over good opportunity after henry had set him up henry took quick return pass from vieira but ashdown was out quickly to block and there were some anxious seconds for pompey as the ball ran loose before matthew taylor cleared after playing second fiddle portsmouth should have taken the lead on minutes referee howard webb played good advantage to allow steve stone to send gary neil away but having shrugged off toure the pompey midfielder planted his shot wide from yards as half time approached henry teased shot through ruck of players and inches wide at the other end fuller broke clear but failed to hit the target as toure closed him down fuller was given the best chance of the match so far on minutes when patrik berger break and slipped pass played him clear but poor first touch lost him the opportunity and even when he checked back and went down under vieira challenge referee webb was not interested fuller paid the price when he gave way on minutes to aiyegbeni yakubu who returned after six weeks out with knee injury but it needed alert reflexes and safe handling from ashdown to cling on to van persie shot as henry sniffed for scraps portsmouth were growing in confidence and keeper manuel almunia had to stand his ground to beat away powerful shot from berger arsenal were struggling to find their rhythm but took the lead through the unlikely source of campbell the england defender needed little invitation as pompey backed off to stride forward and lash ferocious shot past ashdown arsenal might have stretched their lead two minutes later when mathieu flamini escaped his marker to flash header wide from henry free kick almunia went full length to grab berger long range shot

insulting if prize money is taken away somebody think it was mr phillips said they won have money for flowers at wimbledon that insulting an all england club spokesperson denied phillips made the

wimbledon grounds davenport was speaking following the announcement that this week dubai duty free event will join the us and australian opens in offering equal prize money for women you hear about women playing only three sets while men play five said daveport and the best women are never going to beat the best men but it different game you go to watch with the women it doesn make it better or worse hopefully we will be able to change people minds serena williams who is also in dubai added obviously for equal prize money women tennis is exciting men tennis is exciting as well but the women

argentina an injury time dropped goal by ronan gara stole victory for ireland from underneath the noses of argentina at lansdowne road on saturday gara kicked all of ireland points with two dropped goals and five penalties to give the home side record in their autumn internationals an impressive argentina appeared in control until the dying seconds the pumas shocked the irish early on with try from federico aramburu and felipe contepomi kicked points the well drilled and sharper pumas out played and out thought ireland in the early stages indiscipline allowed argentina leinster fly half contepomi to open the scoring in the third minute with straightforward penalty he was on the mark again two minutes later when argentina shocked ragged ireland with the first try of the game ireland turned the ball over and manuel contepomi broke through an unstructured defence before feeding his midfield partner aramburu to sprint in under the posts gara finally got ireland on the board with dropped goal in the ninth minute only for contepomi to rifle over his second penalty two minutes later playing into strong wind and rain ireland continued to come second best in tight situations and turnovers began to mount up against rugged defence gara managed to land his second penalty in the th minute but once again contepomi replied in kind four minutes into first half injury time the second half started as the first had ended gara rifled over another penalty in the th minute but contepomi matched it three minutes later the upper body strength of the pumas never allowed ireland to take control up front while the three quarters had no space to manoeuvre ireland had to rely on gara boot to keep in touch rather than any contrived running plays the munsterman landed two more penalties one of them from metres to bring his team to within four points with minutes on the clock remaining and ireland chance came when argentina number eight gonzalo longo was yellow carded with six minutes to go for an offence in the line out gara made no mistake as he rifled over his fifth penalty to set up tense final few minutes but ireland showed great composure to get themselves into position to allow gara to thump over massive drop goal to complete tremendous if fortuitous comeback radcliffe proves doubters wrong this won go down as one of the greatest marathons of paula career but as test of character it was the toughest race she ever taken part in win in the new york marathon doesn make up for the disappointment of athens in any shape or form but it will offer hope and reassurance for next year if paula last experience of the year had been athens it would have been very difficult to look forward with any optimism she can now draw line under this year and make plans about her future even if she lost this race there would have been lot of positives to take out of it she knows she can dig deep if she needs to it was strong field with number of the girls going into the race with expectations of winning and although two hours minutes wasn one of paula best times it wasn far off the record on difficult course was speaking to paula in the lead up to this race and she said that in many ways she was facing no win situation she thought that if she won people would say why couldn she do that in athens and if she lost people would say her career was over and lot of people were wondering what would happen if paula was forced to drop out of this race as she did in the marathon and in athens but that was never on the cards she might have been beaten but she would have kept running the reasons she was forced to pull out in athens the niggling injuries her lack of energy and the oppressive conditions weren at play here the only question was what position she could finish in most important of all despite all the hype in the media ahead of this race there were never doubts in paula mind if she wasn confident she wouldn have run after all if you re the best in the world at an event you ll always have expectations of winning now paula will take part in the run london km race in london at the end of the year have well earned rest over christmas and go into next year with lot of optimism bell set for england debut bath prop duncan bell has been added to england man squad to face ireland in the rbs six nations and with phil vickery sidelined for at least six weeks with broken arm and julian white out with neck injury bell could make his england debut bell had set his sights on an international career with wales but last december the international rugby board confirmed that he could only be eligible for england as he had travelled on tour with them in england coach andy robinson could take gamble and call inexperienced sale sharks prop andrew sheridan into his front row but sheridan favours the loosehead side of the scrum and more likely scenario is for uncapped bell who was among the tryscorers when england beat france nine days ago to be drafted in robinson also has an injury worry over centre olly barkley who withdrew from bath starting line up to face gloucester last weekend he was due to have hospital scan on monday while gloucester centre henry paul who started at fly half against bath limped out at kingsholm because of an ankle problem despite barkley three missed penalties in the defeat against france he is expected to retain his place at inside centre although leicester in form prospect ollie smith would be an obvious replacement bath coach john connolly rates barkley as no better than chance to make the dublin trip uncapped fly half andy goode has been named in man training squad for the ireland game and he strengthened his selection claims by kicking points during leicester record win against newcastle on sunday england players are due to meet at their surrey training base on monday kewell waits as injury drags on liverpool winger harry kewell is struggling to recover from his achilles tendinitis problem and may not recover until march claims his agent kewell had hoped to play against fulham last weekend and to be ready for the champions league tie against bayer leverkusen on february but bernie mandic said he

harry struggling bit but the club are doing everything they can to get him right harry was desperate to be fit for the fulham game as part of his plan to play himself in for the leverkusen match kewell has not played since december and misses out on international duty this week with australia facing south africa in durban on wednesday faultless federer has no equal roger federer nice bloke fantastic tennis player the ultimate sportsman when lleyton hewitt shook his hand after getting another thrashing third in as many months the australian said you re the best how right he is the stats speak for themselves titles from finals during three of them grand slams and final victories in row going back to vienna that an open era record hewitt at times in houston showed form which easily matched his grand slam winning efforts of and but he was outplayed twice hewitt along with andy roddick and marat safin is sure to be prominent during but realistically all three will be fighting for the world number two ranking according to all those players and even federer himself the swiss star is in different league right now feel that little bit he told bbc sport ve dominated all the top ten players they say nice things about me because have beaten them all am dominating the game right now and hope it continues the number one player in the world is also the main man for promoting the sport off court he has just been voted by the international tennis writers as the best ambassador for tennis on the atp tour he has time for everyone every match from first round to final is followed by series of press interviews in three languages english french and swiss german after major win there are extra requests obligations and interviews all seen through to the end with courtesy and most importantly good humour you guys are funny have good time with you guys he said genuinely happy to talk into yet another tape recorder see you pretty much every day on the tour so to give away an hour for interviews is really no problem for me if can promote tennis and the sport then that is good for me people say thanks back and that is nice what refreshing attitude from someone who could easily dominate the sports pages for decade it sums up his modest personality shortly after collecting waterford crystal trophy mercedes convertible and tasty cheque for federer addressed the houston crowd and concluded by saying thanks for having me now he just needs to find way of winning the french open the one grand slam to so far elude him kenyon denies robben barca return chelsea chief executive peter kenyon has played down reports that arjen robben will return for the champions league match against barcelona he been responding well to treatment and started running on friday but we ll have to wait and see he told bbc five live sportsweek we re looking to getting him back as soon as possible but he ll be back when it right for him and for us there no plans at the moment around the barcelona game his comments contradict those of chiropractor jean pierre meersseman who treated the dutchman after he fractured his foot at the start of february robben had been expected to be out for six weeks but meersseman hinted that the winger could be fit for the vital stamford bridge game on march hope he can be back and will try to help him make that happen meersseman told the mail on sunday put everything right with arjen foot the last time saw him days ago it was an obvious correction and easy to perform know he was pleased with what did and now that he is running again am due to see him one more time again in the next few days meersseman is the medical co ordinator at italian side ac milan what now for kelly holmes last april kelly holmes spoke to the bbc sport website about her loneliness her fight to stay fit and her decision not to contest both the and at the olympics it just goes to show even the most meticulous and measured athletes cannot predict what fate has in store for them four months later holmes stormed to double olympic gold and has since been made dame won the bbc sport personality of the year and written book whilst still finding time to coach aspiring athletes with so much time spent in the spotlight holmes has increasingly dropped hints that her ambition on the track has begun to wilt and when asked about her plans for both the indoor and outdoor seasons ahead the year old has repeatedly chosen to tick the don know box holmes has now pulled out of this weekend european indoor championships where she was selected for both the and because of hamstring injury but should we be surprised if the olympic champion over both those distances decides she just does not feel like racing anymore well it lot easier being the double olympic champion being feted by everybody than training to be at the top in middle distance running points out former olympian and bbc pundit steve cram you have to have real strong desire to carry on doing it even if you re very talented holmes drive and determination have always been unquestionable that is the reason she has battled back from string of injuries that threatened to see her finish her career empty handed but alarm bells start ringing when the kent athlete begins questioning herself will have as much commitment desire and energy to go through major championship holmes asked in the new year that is what don know at holmes will also be aware that time is running out us and legend michael johnson five time olympic gold medallist retired shortly after his th birthday as did britain double olympic champion decathlete daley thompson the physical demands of the day to day grind will only get harder for holmes who has already admitted she doesn like the training anymore whilst out on the circuit the allure of defeating double olympic champion will spur her opponents on holmes will not want to needlessly suffer the indignity of being beaten unless she is certain she has strong chance of winning any race she will not step onto the track but if the kent athlete finds the form that fuelled her ambitions last summer there are more prizes up for grabs the day after completing her double in athens the year old revealed she would still like to win her first indoors title holmes wish could easily be met in madrid before she goes on to prepare for the outdoor season where there are still scores to be settled such as first gold at the world championships in helsinki there is just one small truth which could gnaw away at holmes motivation the realisation that no matter how hard she trains nothing she wins now can surpass her achievements in athens on the other hand if those achievements cannot be matched shouldn they be at least shared and celebrated you don get the chance very often in your career to step onto the track as the double olympic champion agreed cram you want to be able to take your bow in front of the fans because it fantastic feeling think deep down kelly wants to run think she will compete and run races on the circuits but whether or not she runs in the major championships is much less certain athletics fans had every reason to believe they would see the new look kelly holmes tearing up the track again after her olympic glory she emphatically denied she planned to retire so why is holmes dragging her heels about making decision on where when or whether to even bother competing again that just kelly explains cram she always been like that she enjoys people trying to guess what she is going to do next she knows every time she makes pronouncement now it headline news kelly has to figure out for herself what it is she wants and that will be based on athletics decisions whether she can be competitive if she is fit enough to put her neck on the line and if she decides not to run again no one is going to turn round and say you re making the wrong decision murphy that was bruising battle that what call tough game it was very physical and fair play to the italians they made us work very hard for our victory their organisation was very very good and they proved again that they are getting better and better as the years go by it is by far the strongest italian team that we have faced we knew all along that we would be huge threat particularly the first game in the championship it was not like the days gone by when you could get scores on the board early we had to work our socks off and try and build our scores gradually it was really hard work out there and the players have plenty of bumps and bruises to prove it not too bad but there are one or two others who will be feeling it bit on monday morning in the backs we were not frustrated at such but the new rucking laws were little bit problematical the different interpretations between the referee and the players was little difficult but we managed to get the ball in our hands and got try near the end of the first half it always good to score it was great work by brian and always knew had scored even though it went upstairs to the video referee eddie sullivan was very calm at half time even though we were only ahead he spelled out what we needed to do and advocated getting the ball out of our own territory that new ruck law made it bit more difficult to get out of our own half we were penalised lot at the breakdown and if they had kicked all their chances at goal we would have been behind at the break so really we went back to playing territory game and simplifying things and having more patience on the ball every one was little down after the game following the injuries to brian and gordon as yet we do not know the full extent of the injuries but it does not that good now we have to focus on scotland and only six days to recover it big ask after such bruising encounter was very impressed the way the scots played against the french on saturday it could so easily have gone their way but for couple of decisions we will be under no illusions it is going to be tough for us in the meantime when in rome zambia confident and cautious zambia technical director kalusha bwalya is confident and cautious ahead of the cosafa cup final against angola on saturday in lusaka bwalya said nothing short of victory will do however bwalya warned his side not to be too complacent don want my team to be too comfortable or too sure of victory as it is going to be difficult game for me the main aim of the game is to enjoy and to win zambia have shown their determination to win this final by recalling nine of their foreign based players however the year old bwalya who became the oldest player to appear in the competition when he played and scored against mauritius is uncertain whether he will take to the field or not the chipolopolo fans however are not being so cautious with victory concert already scheduled for after the match featuring some of the country top musicians both sides are hoping to win the competition for record third time and so keep the trophy for good the chipolopolo won the first two editions of the regional tournament for southern african nations in and they were prevented from third straight win by angola who knocked out the zambians at the semi final stage in that victory for angola also marked first defeat in years for zambia at lusaka independence stadium where saturday game is being played angola named just four overseas based players in their preliminary squad the palancas negras have been unable to secure the release of many of their portugal based players johnson accuses british sprinters former olympic champion michael johnson has accused britain top sprinters of lacking pride and ambition at the moment the biggest factor on the mind of british sprinters is to be number one in britain the world and record holder told five live athletics at the moment is all about international competitions and they need to show little more pride however linford christie countered it easy to criticise when you haven gone through the system here johnson was involved in verbal spat with britain darren campbell earlier this year the american had cast doubt on campbell claims he had torn hamstring in the wake of his failure to reach the olympic and finals and the american remains highly critical of aspects of british sprinting the only time you see british sprinters getting upset or riled is when there is debate as to which one is better than the other he claimed athletes here have to compete more outside the uk their focus has to be on being the best in the world and not just on being the top british sprinter speaking at an elite coaches conference in birmingham johnson also argued that although there has been more investment in the sport in britain it had not necessarily reaped the rewards you can fix everything with money he admitted you contrast the situation here to that of some us athletes who have no funding those who aren funded might be hungrier and more motivated because their road to success is lot more difficult and challenging so when they get to the top they are more appreciative yeading face newcastle in fa cup premiership side newcastle united

dogged federer claims dubai crown world number one roger federer added the dubai championship trophy to his long list of successes but not before he was given test by ivan ljubicic top seed federer looked to be on course for easy victory when he thumped the eighth seed in the first set but ljubicic who beat tim henman in the last eight dug deep to secure the second set after tense tiebreak swiss star federer was not about to lose his cool though turning on the style to win the deciding set the match was re run of last week final at the world indoor tournament in rotterdam where federer triumphed but not until ljubicic had stretched him all the way really wanted to get off to good start this time and did and could really play with confidence while he still looking for his rhythm federer said that took me all the way through to on his serve and almost ran away with it but he came back and that was good effort on his side ljubicic was at loss to explain his poor showing in the first set didn start badly but then suddenly felt like my racket was loose and the balls were flying little bit too much and with roger if you relax for second it just goes very quick he said after those first three games it was no match at all don know it was really weird was playing really well the whole year and then suddenly found myself in trouble just to put the ball in the court but despite his defeat the world number was pleased with his overall performance had chance in the third and for me it really positive to twice in two weeks have chance against roger to win the match it an absolutely great boost to my confidence that up there and belong with top class players coach ranieri sacked by valencia claudio ranieri has been sacked as valencia coach just eight months after taking charge at the primera liga club for the second time in his career the decision was taken at board meeting following the side surprise elimination from the uefa cup we understand and he understands that the results in the last few weeks have not been the most appropriate said club president juan bautista former assistant antonio lopez will take over as the new coach italian ranieri took over the valencia job in june having been replaced at chelsea by jose mourinho things began well but the spanish champions extended their winless streak to six after losing to racing santander last weekend that defeat was then followed by uefa cup exit at the hands of steaua bucharest ranieri first took charge of valencia in guiding them to the king cup and helping them to qualify for the champions league the year old then moved to atletico madrid in before joining chelsea the following year sullivan quick to hail italians ireland coach eddie sullivan heaped praise on italy after seeing his side stutter to victory in rome it was hell of tough game said sullivan we struggled in the first half because we hadn the football italy played really well they handled the ball well in terms of kicking it if that not an oxymoron we said before the game that it might take until minutes from the end for this game to be won and that how it turned out ireland struggled to cope with italy fierce start and were indebted to skipper brian driscoll who set up tries for geordan murphy and peter stringer we had our first attack in the italian half after minutes said sullivan we had good return with three first half possessions in their half and we scored twice the second half was about spending more time in their half scrum half peter stringer was also glad that ireland escaped wtih victory all credit to them he told bbc sport we knew it would be tough coming to rome they always give us tough game here and they showed lot of spirit they had lot of ball in the first half but we got few scores when we got into their parry puts gerrard above money listen to the full interview on sport on five and the bbc sport website from gmt but parry speaking exclusively to bbc sport also admits gerrard who has been constantly linked with chelsea will have the final say on his future he told bbc five live steven is above money he is the future of liverpool it doesn matter if it or we will not accept offers but we are also realistic enough to know we can keep steven against his will on the subject of liverpool finances parry also revealed the club is ready to explore the possibility of sponsorship deal for its proposed new stadium and responding to criticism from bbc sport pundit and former liverpool stalwart alan hansen he insisted talks on new investment are ongoing but added the door has not closed on shareholder and lifelong fan steve morgan parry joined liverpool as chief executive in july from similar role at the premier league there have been several highs and lows during his time in charge at anfield and he had busy summer overseeing the arrival of new manager rafael benitez and managing to hold on to steven gerrard on the subject of liverpool captain and prize asset parry revealed real madrid did ask for an option on the england midfield man during negotiations for striker fernando morientes he said they were looking for ways of saying they got more out of the deal for fernando morientes but the response to real madrid was the same steven is not for sale but when asked if gerrard would be liverpool player on the first day of next season parry said sincerely hope he will be steven knows my views he knows rafa views we have re affirmed recently to steven that we are trying to build team around him we crave success as much as he does we know he ambitious and nobody can argue with that think steven would dearly love to win things with liverpool more than he like to do anything else we all want to see progress by next season he not alone in that there are lot of other players who feel the same so we all have common aim it is expected chelsea will test liverpool with plus bid in the summer but parry claims he will be in no mood to listen there have been lot of open secrets about steven most of which have been complete myths it is suggested we had deal tied up last summer we didn had an offer last summer parry explained we had told chelsea that as far as we were concerned he was not for sale and we didn want to sell him in reality it didn go beyond that maybe there will be an offer in the summer maybe there won our position is we want steven to stay but we are also realistic enough and have enough respect for steven and he has enough respect for us to know that it is his decision that will be crucial you are not going to keep player like steven against his will that just doesn work but any idea we are going to accept offers for steven and then tell him by the way we ve decided to sell you is not on the agenda you can forget that parry is currently in the process of finalising funding for liverpool new stadium in stanley park which is set to open in and he confessed arsenal deal with emirates to sponsor their new ground complete with naming rights has given the anfield club serious food for thought he said have to say historically it is something have been against and have been on record as saying that but think the size of the arsenal deal is real eye opener would say in the past deals have been done frankly far too cheaply and it just hasn even been worth contemplating but the arsenal deal is the sort of deal that causes you to draw breath and say wow that interesting my personal point of view is that would find it hell of lot more palatable than shared stadium some liverpool fans would find such move highly controversial but parry countered recognise it would be an emotive issue for many supporters but you look at the amount of money available and it could go into the team if it was the right partner how strong an issue is it time will tell think the stadium will always be anfield not least because of where it is but do we need to investigate the possibilities of sponsorship think it would be remiss not to that not to say we have made decision that we will go down that road but think it is clearly something we have to explore on the subject of possible new investment parry revealed liverpool are still in negotiations with mystery investor with rumours of interest from the middle east that prompted the withdrawal of tycoon steve morgan who got frustrated by failed bids and what he claimed was indecision by the board he also accused liverpool of using him as stalking horse to attract other bids but parry explained steve has never been used as stalking horse there no need and that is not the way we do business we had discussions with steve over the course of think we came close to concluding deal in the summer but it didn happen quite genuinely the new interest did appear relatively late in the day just prior to the agm in december and as have said it was of such potential magnitude and that potential is so exciting we felt we had to evaluate it we are still evaluating it steve interest was taken very much on its own merits his enthusiasm for the club is there for all to see and who knows what the next few months will hold the door isn closed on anything we had perfectly sensible dialogue with steve last year we have common interest in making liverpool successful that dream we all share so as far as concerned the door is not closed would take if we had no investment but if we did keep him as for the stadium if it gets us cash what difference does it make really for gerrard don care who you are the directors would take the money and it is the way it should be we cannot let that sum of money go despite gerrard quality through cleverly worded statement the club has effectively forced gerrard to publicly make the decision for himself which think is the right thing to do critical time for liverpool with regards to gerrard ideally we would want to secure his future to the club for the long term am hoping he doesn walk out of the club like michael owen did for very little cash realistically would allow rafa to completely rebuild the squad however if we can afford to do this and keep gerrard we will be better for it would however be happy with gerrard transfer for any fee over parry statements are clever in that any future gerrard transfer cannot be construed as lack of ambition by the club to not try and keep their best players upping the ante is another smart move by parry would keep gerrard no amount of money could replace his obvious love of the club and determination to succeed the key is if gerrard comes out and says that he is happy clearly if he isn then we would be foolish not to sell the worrying thing is who would you buy or who would come pending possible non champions league football henman decides to quit davis cup tim henman has retired from great britain davis cup team the year old who made his davis cup debut in is now set to fully focus on the atp tour and on winning his first grand slam event ve made no secret of the fact that representing great britain has always been top priority for me throughout my career henman told his website captain jeremy bates has touted alex bogdanovic and andrew murray as possible replacements for the veteran henman added that he was available to help britain in its bid for davis cup success with the next tie against israel in march although won be playing would still like to make myself available to both jeremy and the lta in the future so that can draw upon my experience in the hope of trying to help the british players develop their full potential he added ve really enjoyed playing in front of the thousands of british fans both home and abroad and would like to thank every one of them for their unwavering support over the years henman leaves davis cup tennis with an impressive record having won of his matches great britain captain jeremy bates paid tribute to henman efforts over the years tim has quite simply had phenomenal davis cup career and it has been an absolute privilege to have captained the team with him in it said bates tim magnificent record speaks for itself while it great loss completely understand and respect his decision to retire from davis cup and focus on the grand slams and tour looking to the future this decision obviously marks watershed in british davis cup tennis but it is also huge opportunity for the next generation to make their mark we have host of talented players coming through and despite losing someone of tim calibre remain very optimistic about the future henman made his davis cup debut in against romania in manchester he and partner bates won their doubles rubber on the middle saturday of the tie britain eventually lost the contest henman and britain had little luck in davis cup matches until when they qualified for the world group britain drew the usa and lost the tie when greg rusedski fell to jim courier in the deciding rubber they made the

assistant dean goldfine as his new coach roddick ended his month partnership with brad gilbert on monday and goldfine admits talks have taken place we had really good conversation and we re on the same page in terms of what expect from player in commitment and what he wants said goldfine the reading got from him is that would have lot of the qualities he looking for in coach speaking to told south florida sun sentinel newspaper goldfine added that being said from his standpoint which is smart he wants to cover all his bases think andy wants long term relationship and wants to make sure it the right fit the best fit goldfine has worked with todd martin and roddick close friend mardy fish and was an assistant coach with the us olympic team martin is the other name to have been linked to the vacant post alongside roddick lewsey puzzle over disallowed try england josh lewsey has claimed he was denied late try in his side six nations loss to ireland the wasps wing insisted he grounded the ball when he was bundled over the line and said referee jonathan kaplan had made wrong decision positive touched the ball down over the line lewsey told bbc sport it certainly wasn turnover was driven over and put the ball on the ground the whistle went and let go of the ball lewsey added one of the irish players scooped it back after the whistle and to our surprise the referee then gave turnover as far as concerned that incident and mark cueto effort from charlie hodgson cross field kick that led to what looked like good try were the two key elements in the game cueto was also puzzled as to why his try had been disallowed by kaplan don think could have been offside for without doubt was behind the ball said the sale player the move was planned technique it was not off the cuff we rehearse it time and time again wouldn say we were robbed some decisions go with you and some go against you today they went against us and that tough at international level prop jones ready for hard graft adam jones says the wales forwards are determined to set the perfect attacking platform for the backs by dominating the powerful france pack in paris the prop said if we get stuffed in the front five our backs have had it the mentality of the french is scrum scrum scrum we will see how good france are and the scrum is the key just hope the backs carry on where they left off against italy it just up to us in the forwards to win the ball and give them the opportunity wales have won two of their last three visits to stade de france having secured back to back wins under graham henry in and and with the likes of shane williams and gavin henson finding top form at the right time mike ruddock team is now one of international rugby most potent attacking threats gavin is ridiculously talented he has been bouncing around the place this week so he is up for it warned jones france have been criticised for their uncharacteristic one dimensional play in their victories over scotland and france captain fabien pelous has acknowledged his side needs to show more attacking flair but stressed the game with be won or lost up front the lock believes the welsh forwards are not big enough to trouble his side in the scrum or line out but jones insisted his fellow front row colleagues have nothing to fear gethin jenkins won be intimidated tomorrow none of us will said jones who will be facing france for the first time we will go out there and front up and hopefully get the ball out to the backs me and gethin are quite young so it is good to have someone of mefin experience in there mefin is good thinker who puts things across but what is the saying if you are good enough you are old enough and gethin certainly is he is really good player and imagine he will be on the lions tour to new zealand this summer wales get williams fitness boost wales are hopeful that openside flanker martyn williams could be fit for saturday rbs nations championship opener against england in cardiff williams was expected to miss the match with disc problem in his neck but has been making speedy recovery he will have tests in the next hours and we are pretty optimistic he is getting there wales team physiotherapist mark davies said it has been frustrating but he is on the mend he has made good progress last week williams along with fellow flanker colin charvis who is unlikely to play for at least month while he recovers from foot injury was all but ruled out of the millennium stadium clash with williams initially thought to be struggling the signs pointed towards wales coach mike ruddock handing first cap to former wales under skipper richie pugh cardiff blues flanker williams offers considerable experience and if he is declared fit then ruddock might be tempted to include him in the back row charvis will be reviewed by the wales medical staff next monday but davies admitted that there was only an outside chance of him being fit to face france in wales third championship game on february wales other injury concern is pugh fellow neath swansea ospreys player sonny parker as the centre has trapped nerve in his neck sonny injury is still an issue davies said it is still painful and irritable we will run the rule of thumb over him in the next couple of days ruddock will name his starting line up for the england game at gmt on tuesday evening as wales target their first victory in cardiff over the world champions since benitez deflects blame from dudek liverpool manager rafael benitez has refused to point the finger of blame at goalkeeper jerzy dudek after portsmouth claimed draw at anfield dudek fumbled cross before lomana lualua headed home an injury time equaliser levelling after steven gerrard put liverpool ahead benitez said it was difficult for jerzy it was an unlucky moment he was expecting cross from matthew taylor and it ended up like shot so don blame him for what happened benitez admitted it was costly loss of two points by liverpool who followed up their derby defeat against everton with disappointing draw he said we had many opportunities but didn score and in the end lead was not enough if you don have any chances you have to think of other things but when you are creating so many chances as we are there is nothing you can say to the players it was pity we lost two points but we have one more point in the table now we have another difficult game against newcastle and we have to recover quickly from that candela completes bolton switch bolton boss sam allardyce has signed roma defender vincent candela on five month deal the year old former france international gave his last press conference as roma player on monday anouncing his move to bolton have signed five month contract with bolton

including the world cup in he has not played regular football this year but is eager to impress in the premiership he can play in any position at the back and despite him being predominately right footed he has played the majority of his career at left back candela who was member of the roma side that won the title in has made only seven league appearances this season for luigi del neri side scotland italy six chris paterson penalties gave scotland victory in dour but clinical encounter against italy at murrayfield coach matt williams side were outmuscled and outplayed in tense first half but led at the break paterson slotted four more second half penalties and scotland were denied try when wing sean lamont touchdown was ruled out for forward pass late andrea masi try was small consolation for italy chasing their first away win in the six nations scotland came out on top of the early exchanges and took quick lead through the boot of full back paterson but the more powerful azzurri pack eventually rumbled into life series of drives into scottish territory set up penalty attempt missed by full back roland de marigny and wayward drop goal effort from luciano orquera scotland defended the initial thrusts but on minutes italy after coming up yards short of the line equalised through de marigny penalty italy were offered another penalty when scottish flanker simon taylor was offside but the left footed de marigny pushed his kick wide scotland finally made the most of rare foray into the italian half and snatched three points from paterson when an italian forward handled the ball in ruck as the half wore on both sides squandered promising spells of momentum with sloppy penalties and the period fizzled out with scotland numerically if not psychologically on top italy de marigny narrowly missed chance to level the scores again shortly after the break but his long range kick shaved the right upright and scotland capitalised with third paterson penalty on minutes williams side seemed to have found spark from somewhere and after couple of probing attacks paterson was able to slot another three points to widen the gap with the pendulum of possession swinging towards scotland lamont thought he had wriggled over in the left corner after minutes but play was recalled for marginal forward pass from paterson another paterson penalty on minutes kept the pressure on the wilting visitors but john kirwan men had the last laugh when gordon ross attempted clearance was charged down and masi pounced for the try converted by de

fixture being played just after christmas said neill we will have to speak with the bulgarian fa it their prerogative for them to arrange fixture and our prerogative how we handle it bulgaria game comes between celtic boxing day meeting with hearts and their january fixture against livingston neill believes the extra game will not help midfielder whose season has already been affected by injury they have organised game at rather awkward time he added when we were out playing barcelona spoke with the bulgarian manager hristo stoichkov and he mentioned this game to me we pay his wages we are the ones that if an awkward fixture is going to be played at some stage or another it should be to our benefit rather than anyone else have said this before but bulgaria are the one nation who seem to

slipped to in the world after year of illness and injuries in but is confident that his form will return don know when it is going to happen ferrero told bbc sport but have lot of confidence in me

add to just two wins in he opens against rainer schuettler and potentially faces fourth seed david nalbandian in the second round because no longer seeded it tougher ferrero admitted had to play against joachim johansson in the first round last week in marseille in the past when was top seed would have played match like that in the quarters or semi finals this is the big difference but have to do it to get higher in the rankings despite this ferrero insists he is feeling positive after chicken pox and rib injury destroyed last season physically am since december of last year said ferrero was working very hard before the davis cup final to prepare and ve felt from then until now the difficult moments were when knew that had the chicken pox and that it would take two or three months to recover had to start from zero again physically because the virus left me at zero per cent when started to come back had my rib broken when fell on court and that was another two months out those five months were pretty difficult for me among the low points of difficult year for ferrero was the decision of spain captain jordi arrese to drop him for the davis cup final against the usa it was difficult because had been playing well for the whole year and the coaches told me that would play said ferrero but then had some problems with my hand two days before the friday matches so they decided to choose nadal instead it was difficult for me not to be in the friday matches but had to understand inside me wanted to play but this was the decision of the captain and they had to make it call for kenteris to be cleared kostas kenteris lawyer has called for the doping charges against the greek sprinter to be dropped gregory ioannidis has submitted new evidence to greek athletics tribunal which he claims proves the former olympic champion has no case to answer kenteris and compatriot katerina thanou were given provisional suspensions in december for failing to take drugs tests before the athens olympics the greek tribunal is expected to give its verdict early next week kenteris and thanou withdrew from the athens olympics last august after missing drugs tests on the eve of the opening ceremony they were also alleged to have avoided tests in tel aviv and chicago before the games but ioannidis said everything overwhelmingly shows that the charges should be dropped ioannidis also said he has presented evidence that will throw different light on the events leading up to the pair sensational withdrawal from the athens games the lawyer added that he has proof the authorities knew kenteris was in germany at the time he was alleged to have missed test in chicago nick davies spokesman for athletics ruling body the iaaf which handed out the provisional bans said we can comment because we were not present at the hearing and don know what was said behind closed doors we expect verdict from the greek athletics federation before the end of february and will

knees in celebration after serving out the match against bondarenko it is big moment in my career and would like to thank everyone who has been part of my effort she said this win has made me believe more in myself and can now hope to do better in the coming days wanted to win this tournament very badly since it was in my hometown at the australian open in january mirza became the first indian woman to reach the third round of grand slam before losing to eventual champion serena williams and year ago she became the youngest indian to win professional title by claiming the doubles at the hyderabad open mirza playing in her first wta final began nervously in front of raucous home crowd committing three double faults in her opening service game but from down mirza broke serve twice in row and held on to her advantage to take the first set in see saw second set bondarenko raced into lead and though mirza hauled herself level the ukrainian broke again before finally levelling the match mirza rediscovered the aggressive strokes that took her to the first set in the decider established lead at the stadium erupted in celebration when mirza thought she had delivered an ace to secure victory but the serve was ruled to have clipped the net mirza eventually lost the point but to the relief of the crowd she broke bondarenko again in the next game to clinch the title arsenal through on penalties arsenal win on penalties the spanish goalkeeper saved from alan quinn and jon harley as arsenal sealed quarter final trip to bolton with victory on penalties lauren patrick vieira freddie ljungberg and ashley cole scored for arsenal while andy gray and phil jagielka were on target for the blades michael tonge and harley wasted chances for the underdogs but paddy kenny was inspired to keep arsenal at bay arsenal stripped of attacking talent such as thierry henry and dennis bergkamp partnered year old italian striker arturo lupoli with ljungberg up front it was revamped arsenal line up and they were almost goal behind within seconds as tonge wasted glorious chance gray ran free down the right flank and his cross left tonge with the simplest of chances but he blazed over the top from six yards arsenal were barely seen as an attacking force in the opening minutes although ljungberg turned half chance wide after good work by cesc fabregas arsene wenger introduced quincy owusu abeyie for the ineffective lupoli at half time and the pacy dutch youngster had an immediate impact he ran clear after good work by mathieu flamini but his finish was tame and kenny saved easily owusu abeyie then fired in testing cross which was met by fabregas and it needed desperate clearance by kenny legs to save the blades arsenal were now totally dominant and were desperately unlucky not to take the lead after minutes when fabregas crashed rising drive against the bar from yards it then took brilliant tackle by jagielka to deny ljungberg as he was poised to strike arsenal continued to press and once again kenny was called into action with eight minutes left diving low to clutch another close range effort from fabregas neil warnock side almost snatched victory in the dying seconds when derek geary cross found harley at the far post but his diving header was brilliantly turned over by almunia owusu abeyie pace was causing all sorts of problems for the blades and as extra time began another surging run into the penalty area almost set up chance for ljungberg pascal cygan missed arsenal best chance after minutes blazing across the face of goal when he was unmarked at the far post arsenal sent on jeremie aliadiere with seven minutes of extra time left and he almost broke the deadlock with his first touch kolo toure misplaced free kick landed at his feet but kenny once again blocked from tight angle arsenal laid siege to sheffield united goal in the dying minutes but they somehow held on to force penalties almunia was then arsenal hero as another brave

kit after the abandonment real sociedad president jose luis astiazaran said we thought the best thing was to play the time remaining hundreds of fans streamed across the pitch on their way to the exits after the game was called off tourists and fans took advantage of the opportunity for photograph between the famous stadium goalposts the two clubs met the spanish fa on monday and astiazaran added we thought about giving the game as concluded but after talking with the fa we decided there was no precedent for that and the best thing was to play the time that was remaining real madrid director of sport emilio butragueno praised the spectators inside the ground for their conduct like to highlight the behaviour of the fans who showed great maturity and it was an example of good citizenship he said butragueno confirned before confirming that tuesday charity match which has been billed as ronaldo friends against zidane friends will go ahead as planned also like to take the chance to say that tomorrow game will take place butragueno declared of the partido contra la pobreza game against poverty he added football is important for society and we want to show that we also think that football should be fiesta we had programmed and people deserve to enjoy the game man city man utd manchester united reduced chelsea premiership lead to nine points after scrappy victory over manchester city wayne rooney met gary neville cross to the near post with low shot which went in via deflection off richard dunne to put united ahead seven minutes later the unfortunate dunne hooked volley over david james head and into his own net steve mcmanaman wasted city best chance when he shot wide from three yards in the first half in the opening minutes united had looked unlikely to earn the win they needed to maintain any chance of catching chelsea in the title race their approach play was more laboured than patient and they managed to fashion just one chance paul scholes header over the bar and city seemed to be content to sit back and try and hit their rivals on the break as the game settled into tepid pattern only shaun wright phillips appeared capable of interrupting the monotony looking lively down the right and causing gabriel heinze problems wes brown also found wright phillips to be difficult opponent when the tricky winger embarrassed him near the touchline wright phillips sublime skill and pace took him past brown and he delivered pin point centre to the feet of mcmanaman but the former liverpool player demonstrated why he has never scored against united by side footing the easy chance wide john shea was forced off after an earlier clash with sylvain distin and cristiano ronaldo came on to replace him he immediately caused ben thatcher some discomfort and looked set to inject some much needed pace into the united attack rooney was being well marshalled by dunne but that was all about to change after the break united poured forward and there was renewed urgency about their play and when neville delivered cross in carbon copy of city best first half chance rooney showed mcmanaman how to do it even if he needed the help of dunne leg worse was to come for dunne who had been having fine match on minutes he scored horrible own goal when attempting to volley clear rooney cross and united seemed home and dry however city did fight back and fowler missed another great chance from close range and united keeper roy carroll saved well from kiki musampa but united could have had third late on when substitute ryan giggs hit the post manchester city boss kevin keegan we had great chance to take the lead and the first goal was always going to be crucial we started off with good tempo but then we allowed them to dictate the pace bit too much but we still had four good chances two after we gone down the one mcmanaman missed was very similar to the one wayne rooney scored from manchester united boss sir alex ferguson it wasn our best performance of the last three months but think we re deserved winners at times especially in the first half we didn play with enough speed but with cristiano ronaldo and ryan giggs on the speed improved derby games can be like that they can be scrappy dull horrible and it was maybe like that man city james mills bradley wright phillips dunne distin thatcher shaun wright phillips barton

thomas as wales captain will be straightforward because of the leadership quality in the squad you dream about playing for wales but it never enters your head that you will one day captain your country he said it an easy job really because there are so many experienced players in the side but it will be massive honour coach mike ruddock says the year old should take the armband from broken thumb victim thomas against scotland ruddock praised owen contribution as vice captain and pack leader in this year wins over england italy and france notably his role in the second half in paris following thomas injury the cap dragons man says that thomas will be badly missed though gareth is going to be massive loss because he is brilliant player and he has done fantastic job since he has been captain said owen he has put his own unique stamp on things we are going to miss him but the strength of the squad is shown when you have someone like kevin morgan to step in owen admitted the grand slam had been mentioned within the squad but that no one was getting carried away with the three victories over england italy and france we can get ahead of ourselves he said we have massive game next up and we are just looking forward to preparing for that scotland are improving all the time like us they did well in france and were unlucky not to get win against ireland they played fantastically well in the first minutes before falling away they are probably going on similar journey to the one we have been on in the last couple of years gronkjaer agrees switch to madrid jesper gronkjaer has agreed move to atletico madrid from birmingham city the year old winger spent just five months at st andrews following move from chelsea in july after playing for denmark at euro he is set to move during the january transfer window in deal rumoured to be about subject to medical we will meet with the player representative to finalise the contract and decide when he will sign said atletico sporting director toni munoz gronkjaer has been targeted by blues fans and was sarcastically applauded when taken off against everton last month boss steve bruce had said that he would be happy to let the danish international go if the price was right he added not going to say the decision to let him go is down to the fans reaction towards him he has had tough time since the summer with the loss of his mother and finding it difficult to adjust to new club and different area he has been terrific and not missed day training and is someone if your daughter brought them home you would be delighted it just hasn quite worked out here for him but we like to get back most of what we spent connor aims to grab opportunity johnny connor is determined to make big impression when he makes his rbs six nations debut for ireland against scotland on saturday the wasps flanker replaces denis leamy but connor knows that the munster man will be pushing hard for recall for the following game against england it horses for courses selection really said connor there lot of competition here and can just drag my heels around if don get picked it looks definite head to head battle between himself and year old leamy three stone heavier than connor for the number seven role against the world champions nonetheless all connor is currently concerned about is making an impression while winning his third cap missing the italian game was disappointing certainly but you can dwell on these things it part and parcel of rugby denis has been playing really well and deserved his opportunity it good situation to be in if there are good players around you pushing for place in the side connor who celebrated his th birthday on wednesday was touted by wasps director of rugby warren gatland as possible lions test openside as far back as last september and his reputation as breakdown scavenger and heavy hitter has seen him come to the forefront of sullivan mind for the scottish tussle connor added it will be interesting to see how situations on the deck is reffed with the new laws having come in obviously the breakdown big part of what do on the pitch so hoping to hold some influence there against what is very solid scottish pack connor will be winning his third cap after making his debut in the victory over south africa last november costin aims for comeback in jamie costin should be paralysed he says so himself in matter of fact way as he recalls the car accident which occurred nine days before he was scheduled to step out into the olympic stadium in athens for the walk there is an ironic chuckle as he talks of his immediate thoughts after lorry driving on the wrong side of the road had ploughed into his rental car was in lot of pain and guessed that one of my toes was broken says the waterford man but was thinking maybe with cortisone injection you never know in my back it felt as though all the muscles had been ripped off my pelvis but was thinking maybe we could do something with laser therapy and ultra sound and hopefully be able to race it took over hours before jamie knew with certainty that he would not be competing in his second olympics my back had been broken in two places and with one of my vertebrae the bottom part had exploded so fierce lucky not be paralysed fractured my big toe as well which was on the brake jamie didn finally arrive at hospital in athens until some nine and half hours after the accident for the first nine hours had no pain killers which was ridiculous in degrees heat but once got the scans and saw them it was case of moving on and thinking ok ve got different set of circumstances now within three days he was arriving back in ireland by air ambulance doctors in athens had wanted to operate on jamie back immediately but he insisted on delaying any surgery until he arrived back home something he is now very relieved about the greek doctors were going to put three or four inch titanium rods either side of my spinal cord up through my vertebrae that would have fused all my lower back and would never have been able to race again they were really putting lot of pressure on me to agree to the surgery but when got to the mater in dublin they said it was possible for it to heal totally naturally which is giving me the chance to get back into competition which is very important to me the people at the mater have been absolutely fantastic jamie had to wear body cast for three and half months after the accident and spent most of that time flat on his back he then progressed to crutches for six weeks until he was finally able to walk unaided on january walking without the crutches seemed like something finally really measurable in terms of my recovery physio sessions with johnston mcevoy in limerick have been vital part of his recovery johnston uses an advanced type of acupuncture and it very effective needles get put right close up to my spine two and half inch needle went in yesterday and fairly incapacitated today as result jamie has also travelled to receive treatment at the polish training centre in spala where he has trained with triple olympic champion robert korzeniowski over the past five years was there for over fortnight earlier this month and underwent fair extreme treatment called cryotherapy basically there small room which is cooled by liquid nitrogen to minus degrees centigrade and it promotes deep healing jamie heads to poland again on sunday where he will be having daily cryotherapy in addition to twice daily physio sessions and pool work all these sessions are small steps on the way to what jamie hopes will be return to racing in it all about trying to get mobility in my back lying down for three and half months didn really help with the strength there lot of work involved in my recovery doing about six hours day between physio and pool work also going to the gym to lift very light weights to try and build up my muscles fairly full on with everything do hope to be training regularly by march but training is just part of the process of getting back at the moment every time go and do big bit of movement my whole pelvic area all down my lower back just tightens up it case of waiting and seeing how it reacts hopefully after four or five months my back won tighten up as much chelsea clinch cup in extra time after extra time score at mins john arne riise volleyed liverpool ahead after seconds but steven gerrard scored th minute own goal blues boss jose mourinho was sent off for taunting liverpool fans after the goal and he watched on television as his side went on to win the game drogba and kezman scored from close range before antonio nunez header made for tense finale it was an amazing climax which gave mourinho his first silverware as chelsea manager yet it was controversial too after mourinho sending off apparently for putting his finger to his lips to hush the liverpool fans there was no hushing them after the extraordinary opening in which the reds took stunning lead inside the first minute riise could not have connected any better with morientes cross as he smashed left foot volley past petr cech the goal the quickest ever in league cup final stunned blues side whose previously rock solid confidence had been shaken by consecutive losses to newcastle and barcelona in the previous week the blues attacking chances were limited and jerzy dudek was equal to frank lampard powerfully struck drive and drogba low shot despite their frustration chelsea began to dominate midfield without seriously threatening to break liverpool well organised defence joe cole had shot blocked and promising damien duff break was halted by good tackle from djimi traore but the reds reached half time without any major scares the blues began the second half with more urgency and pegged liverpool back nevertheless liverpool were living dangerously and they needed fantastic double save from dudek on minutes first at full stretch from gudjohnsen header then to smother william gallas follow up and despite chelsea possession it was liverpool who fashioned the next clear opportunity as luis garcia fed dietmar hamann whose shot forced superb save from cech and the blues increasingly adventurous approach saw liverpool earn another chance on the break on minutes as paulo ferreira denied gerrard with last ditch tackle but gerrard was on the scoresheet minutes later in the most unfortunate fashion as he inadvertently deflected ferrerira free kick past his own keeper and in off the post to bring chelsea level that prompted mourinho reaction which saw him sent off but chelsea still pressed and duff had chance to win the game with seven minutes remaining dudek saved bravely at the irishman feet while milan baros shot wildly at the other end to ensure extra time drogba almost headed chelsea in front two minutes into extra time but the striker saw the ball rebound off the post but seconds after the half time interval drogba made no mistake picking the ball up from glen johnson long throw inside the six yard box and sidefooting home and kezman appeared to have made the game safe as he netted from close range after gudjohnsen cross in the th minute there was still drama as nunez beat cech to high ball with six minutes remaining to head his side level but despite liverpool desperate attacks chelsea clung on to win dudek finnan carragher hyypia traore biscan luis garcia gerrard hamann riise kewell nunez morientes baros subs not used pellegrino carson hyypia traore hamann carragher

last four points of the first set tie break before being broken at the start of the second set but he broke straight back and then broke haas again to lead it extremely frustrating when you have chances against top five player and don do anything with them admitted haas rushed few backhands and he took advantage saulnier will move into the world top for the first time after his passage

drawn against samoa france italy georgia and chinese taipei the top two sides in each pool qualify but england could face winners new zealand in the quarter finals if they stumble against samoa scotland and ireland are in pool together with the all blacks england won the first event of the international rugby board world sevens series in dubai but have slipped to fourth in the table after failing to build on that victory however they beat samoa in the recent los angeles sevens before losing to argentina in the semi finals england have the ability and determination to win this world cup and create sporting history by being the only nation to hold both the and sevens world cups at the same time said england sevens coach mike friday england have fantastic record in hong kong and have won there the last three years but the world cup is on different level every pool contains teams who have caused upsets before and we will have to work hard to ensure we progress from our group we

was suffering another australian open final nightmare when he lost the opening set to lleyton hewitt the russian who lost the and finals fought back brilliantly to win was nervous and couldn play tennis said safin he started really well he wasn as nervous as was because was thinking of the two finals that played and wasn successful he added you really have to deal with the pressure because normally it never happens but when you come to the final you are so tight because you want to win tried to play some tennis but couldn he has huge experience he won two grand slam titles he won titles he great player and he deals with pressure from down in the third set safin played some of his best tennis to reel off seven games and take control of the match in the third set just all of sudden it all turn around completely in way couldn expect said safin because he made couple of mistakes was little bit lucky at some point then the confidence came back and was back in the game and the russian revealed that the victory and his semi final win over world number one roger federer had given him massive boost for the future you get huge confidence because roger is great player said safin once beat him and then lleyton it like you get so much confidence in yourself that you really can play great you can win big titles and you can beat huge players in the finals and semi finals sociedad set

expected in san sebastian later this week following his national side game against bulgaria sociedad are in th place in the strong primera liga just two points above the relegation zone special permission from the spanish fa came after an injury to central defender igor jauregi the versatile mladenovic can also play in the back four his agent said last month that rangers had told him to find the player new club mladenovic time at ibrox has been plagued with injury and he has made just six starts in six months with the glasgow club middlesbrough charlton late header by teenager danny graham earned middlesbrough battling draw with charlton at the riverside matt holland had put the visitors ahead in the th minute after his shot took deflection off franck queudrue but middlesbrough peppered the charlton goal after the break and chris riggott stroked home the equaliser shaun bartlett strike put charlton back in front but that lead lasted just six minutes before graham rushed onto queudrue pass to head home the match burst to life from the whistle and charlton defender hermann hreidarsson had sight of an open goal after just six minutes hreidarsson received danny murphy free kick from the right but he crashed his free header wide of the far post the iceland international looked such danger the boro bench could be heard issuing frantic instructions to mark him charlton early pressure paid off when bartlett received long ball from talal el karkouri in the box and laid it off to holland who buried his right footed strike szilard nemeth recalled in place of joseph desire job was twice denied his chance to get middlesbrough back on level terms by dean kiely the striker played great one two with jimmy floyd hasselbaink only to see kiely get down well to smother his shot before directing header straight into the keeper arms boro had plenty of time on the ball but the addicks comfortably mopped up the pressure with kiely tipping hasselbaink header over the bar to take their lead into half time it was all one way traffic after the break at the riverside as middlesbrough poured forward and kiely even saved hreidarsson blushes when he palmed the ball away to prevent charlton own goal but the addicks keeper could do nothing about riggott equaliser in the th minute the boro defender looked suspiciously offside as he got on the end of gareth southgate misdirected effort but despite the charlton protests his goal stood the addicks did not let their heads drop and bartlett left the boro defence standing picking up hreidarsson cross to easily sink his right footed strike but substitute graham was on hand to grab share of the points for the home side the year old striker nodding home the equaliser and his first premiership goal with five minutes left on the clock felt we did enough to win the game even though the first half was lacklustre we dominated after the break the players showed fantastic response and we should have gone on to win but for charlton goalkeeper dean kiely who made three tremendous saves we could have scored five or six to take the lead and then to get penned back it feels little bit like defeat admitted kiely we were winning but middlesbrough kept knocking on the door but we stood up and credit to us we didn capitulate we ll kick on now our short term ambition is to progress from the seventh place finish from last

roddick spain rafael nadal beats andy roddick of the usa in the second singles match rubber of the davis cup final in seville spain lead after carlos moya beat mardy fish in straight sets in the opening match of the tie nadal holds his nerve and the crowd goes wild as spain go up in the tie roddick holds serve to force nadal to serve for the match but the american surely cannot turn things around now nadal works roddick around the court on two consecutive points to earn two break points one is enough the spaniard secures the double break and roddick is now teetering on the edge roddick is trying to gee himself up but the clay surface is taking its toll on his game and he is looking tired nadal wins the game to love nadal steps up the pressure to break and spain have the early initiative in the fourth set nadal also holds convincingly as both players feel their way into the fourth set roddick shrugs off the disappointment of losing the third set tiebreak and breezes through his first service game of the fourth set nadal earns the first mini break in the tiebreak as the match enters its fourth hour couple of stunning points follow one where nadal chases down roddick shot and turns into passing winner then roddick produces some amazing defence at the net to take the score to roddick has two serves for the set but double faults to take the score to nadal saves roddick set point then earns his own with drive volley and crosscourt passing winner sends the crowd wild nadal tries to up his aggression and he passes roddick down the line to go and two set points up roddick saves the first with desperate lunge volley and smacks volley winner across the court to take the score back to deuce before securing the game the set will go to another tiebreak nadal enjoys another straightforward hold and roddick must once again serve to stay in the set roddick again holds on despite some brilliant shot making from his opponent nadal races through his service game to put the pressure straight back onto roddick roddick hangs in on his serve to level matters but nadal is making him fight for every point nadal could be suffering disappointment hangover from the previous game as he goes down and then has to save break point after tremendous rally in which he is forced into some brilliant defence but it pays off and the spaniard edges ahead in the set roddick serve is not firing as ferociously as usual and has to rely on his sheer competitive determination to stay in the set three times nadal forces break point and three times the world number two hangs in and roddick grit pays off as he manages to hold roddick still looks bit sluggish but he attacks the net and is rewarded with break point which nadal saves with good first serve and the spaniard goes on to hold there is disruption in play as roddick is upset about something in the crowd the spanish captain gets involved as does the match referee but it is unclear what the problem is one thing for certain is that the crowd are roused into support of nadal and they go wild when roddick loses the next point and goes break point down roddick saves the break point and then bangs down his ninth ace before clinching the game with service winner the game passes the two hour mark as nadal holds serve to edge ahead in the third set now roddick has to defend break point and he produces characteristic ace to save it it is immediately followed by another and he holds with little dinked half volley winner roddick is looking little leaden footed but does carve out break point for himself but he plays it poorly and nadal avoids the danger roddick has gone off the boil and again struggles he fails to get down properly for low forehand volley and gives nadal three break points the american blasts an ace to save one but follows up with double fault and the rubber is level nadal edges towards taking the second set with comfortable hold two good serves put roddick up but he then makes couple of errors to find himself down he saves the break point with an ace and then manages to hold roddick level has dropped while nadal is on hot streak the spaniard includes superb crosscourt winner off the back foot as he races through his service game without dropping point roddick double faults twice and nadal takes full advantage of the break point offered powering passing winner past roddick nadal wins another tight game neither player has dipped from the high standard of play in the first set nadal puts the american under pressure and roddick saves break point with superb stop volley before going on to hold nadal puts the disappointment of losing the first set tiebreak to claim the opening game in the second roddick double faults to concede the first mini break and then nadal loops crosscourt winner to seize advantage in the tiebreak he lets one slip but wins his next serve to earn three set points but roddick saves them and then earns one himself nadal comes up with down the line winner but then nets tamely on roddick next set point nadal nerve is tested as he tries to force tiebreak both players come up with some scintillating tennis and the spaniard has several chances to clinch the game before finally doing so when roddick drives wide pulsating game sees nadal racing round the court retrieving and refusing to give roddick any easy points the point of the match so far involves roddick slam dunk smash being returned by nadal before roddick finally manages to end the rally on the very next point nadal blasts forehand service return from right of court that passes roddick and even the american is forced to applaud but roddick comes up with two big serves to polish off the game nadal outplays roddick to reach but the american fights back to before nadal powerful crosscourt forehand winner secures the game the crowd are getting very involved cheering between roddick first and second serves but the american comes through to hold and edge ahead in the set nadal manages to hold again despite roddick piling the pressure on his serve the spaniard wins the game courtesy of another lucky net cord roddick double faults buts manages to keep his composure well placed serve is unreturnable and roddick holds powerful ace down the middle gives nadal simple love service game the first time he has held serve so far in the match if roddick didn know before he knows now that he is in real contest another superb game as nadal breaks to once again lift the roof he produces some fine groundstrokes to leave roddick chasing shadows four of the first five games have seen break of serve despite the disappointment of losing his serve roddick is not phased and storms into lead when the umpire leaves his seat to confirm close line call nadal takes the next point but roddick breaks again with sharp volley at the net roddick advantage is short lived as nadal breaks back immediately fortunate net cord helps the spaniard on his way and when roddick fires forehand cross court shot wide to lose his serve nadal pumps his fist in celebration the american is pumped up for this clash and takes on nadal serve from the start nadal drop shot is agonisingly called out and roddick claims the vital first break after moya win in the opening rubber raucous seville crowd is buoyed by nadal impressive start which sees him race into lead however roddick fights back to hold his serve houllier praises benitez regime former liverpool manager gerard houllier has praised the work of his anfield successor rafael benitez houllier was angry at reports that he has been

for criticism rangers manager alex mcleish accepts he is going to be criticised after their disastrous uefa cup exit at the hands of auxerre at ibrox on wednesday mcleish told bbc radio five live we were in pole position to get through to the next stage but we blew it we absolutely blew it there no use burying your head in the sand we know we are going to get lot of criticism we have to take it as we have done in the past and we must now bounce back mcleish admitted his team defending was amateurish after watching them lose to guy roux french side very disappointed because we didn give ourselves chance losing the first goal from our own corner it was amateur he added the early goal in the second half gave us mountain to climb and we never created the same kind of chances as we did in the first half it difficult to take positives from the game we ve let the fans down liverpool revel in night of glory liverpool manager rafael benitez said their qualification for the next stage of the champions league was one of the proudest nights of my career the reds beat olympiakos with late steven gerrard strike and benitez said it was really great night the players ran hard all the time and you see how much it means to the fans we knew before the game that it was very important for the club to gain these extra finances for liverpool this result is very very important benitez hailed gerrard for his match winning strike four minutes from time and also the anfield crowd for sticking by their side after they had fallen goal behind at the interval the reds scored three second half goals in sensational comeback capped by gerrard yard drive he added steven can play all over the pitch and he influences every part of the game have said to him many times that he has the freedom because he has talent and is very important to us felt that the difference between the sides was really our supporters cannot thank them enough want to say thank you to the supporters they were magnificent to help us achieve this result gerrard admitted he thought they were going out of the champions league after trailing at half time he said be lying if thought we were going through when we were losing at half time we had mountain to climb but we have climbed it and credit to everyone that was one of the best goals have scored caught it sweet haven caught one like that for ages it was massive night for me and the team liverpool win means all four of england champions league representatives have reached the knockout stages for the first time mcilroy aiming for madrid title northern ireland man james mcilroy is confident he can win his first major title at this weekend spar european indoor championships in madrid the year old has been in great form in recent weeks and will go in as one of the metres favourites believe after my wins abroad and in our trial race in sheffield can run my race from the front back or middle said mcilroy new coach tony lester has helped get mcilroy career back on track the year old metres runner has not always matched his promise with performances but believes his decision to change coaches and move base will bring the rewards mcilroy now lives in windsor and feels his career has been transformed by the no nonsense leadership style of former army sergeant lester lester is better known for his work with runners roger black and mark richardson in the past but under his guidance mcilroy has secured five wins this indoor season mcilroy now claims he is in his best shape since finishing fourth for ireland at the outdoor european championships in that was my last decent year said mcilroy who temporarily retired last august before returning to the sport under lester shrewd guidance before every race was like trying to climb mount everest and now know you can do it on your own trying to succeed saw me sometimes standing half dead and terrified on the starting line which became bit too much mcilroy who was compared to the likes of sebastian coe steve cram and steve ovett in his younger days is now competing without the benefit of national lottery funding that situation could change if he maintains his current form and repeats the world class times he produced in the and at major races in erfurt and stuttgart earlier this season russian dmitriy bogdanov won at the same madrid venue last week and then claimed the european championship race would be between himself dutchman arnoud okken and antonio reina of spain but mcilroy is unfazed he admitted he looked quite good in his win and fair enough everyone has the right to their own opinion never write myself off and let face it haven or looked like being beaten this season and mcilroy whose time of one minute seconds in erfurt elevated him to sixth place on the uk all time list is also already looking beyond madrid he said ve been much more focused this year about my career and having such good team around me has been very important ultimately of course this weekend is means to an end and that is getting prepared for the summer world championships that ambition has meant that ve had only two nights out since last august the rest of my time has seen me just concentrating on rebuilding my career trial date is set for balco case us judge has set preliminary trial date for the balco steroid distribution case which has rocked athletics us district court judge susan ilston

enhancing drugs to elite athletes to be heard firm decision on whether the trial takes place is expected in january the judge said that she may conduct hearings in january into whether federal agents illegally searched the balco headquarters and wrongfully obtained statements from the company founder victor conte and its vice president james valente the two men along with personal trainer greg anderson and athletics coach remy korchemny were all indicted earlier this year but have pleaded their innocence the outcome of those hearings could result in some or all of the charges being dismissed conte said that he would be telling his side of the story on an american tv show on friday the world deserves to know the truth about performance enhancing drugs he said balco the bay area laboratory cooperative is the company at the centre of the scandal the company has been accused by the united states anti doping agency usada of being the source of the banned steroid thg and

been banned on the basis of materials discovered during the balco investigation britain former european champion dwain chambers is currently serving two year ban after testing positive for thg in an out of competition test in chelsea hold arsenal gripping game between arsenal and chelsea ended with the honours finishing even at highbury thierry henry produced sublime strike to put arsenal ahead but john terry levelled with powerful header henry quickly taken free kick put arsenal back in front but eidur gudjohnsen equalised with header from william gallas knockback henry missed golden chance when he blazed shot high late on and arsenal also had penalty appeal rejected henry opener had given arsenal the perfect start and set up an enthralling affair the french striker headed long cesc faregas ball back to jose antonio reyes from the edge of the chelsea area and immediately saw it headed back into his path from the spaniard and with his back to goal henry finished with aplomb when he took one touch turned and struck an angled strike past the despairing dive of keeper petr cech henry epitomised determination about the arsenal side but chelsea appeared unruffled and equalised after minutes gunners keeper manuel almunia who got the nod ahead of jens lehmann did well to save well struck frank lampard shot but he could not keep out terry powered header from the resultant corner as arsenal weakness at set pieces was again exposed almost immediately henry went close and chelsea gathered the loose ball before going straight up the other end where gudjohnsen fluffed an effort gudjohnsen did not make the same error minutes later when he struck sweet shot only for almunia to be equal to the task and save the homes side regained the lead in controversial fashion when robert pires won dubious free kick and given the option to take the yard set piece quickly henry curled in shot with cech still organising his wall this time arsenal did not allow chelsea to level so soon as they went into the break ahead chelsea brought striker didier drogba on to partner gudjohnsen up front after the interval and the move reaped immediate reward lampard swung in cross which gallas knocked back across goal and deft header from gudjohnsen levelled matters again chelsea main threat was coming from crosses and lampard missed great opportunity as he headed wide when left unmarked at the far post the second half failed to live up to the thrilling pace of the opening period but there were flashes of brilliance one of them came from the enigmatic robben when he jinked his way through two arsenal defenders only to see his poked shot saved by almunia arsenal ended the match the stronger and worked excellent chance for henry who put left foot shot high from eight yards subtitute robin van persie could also have nicked win for the highbury outfit but frustratingly sidefooted just wide matthieu flamini had late penal appeal waved away before the final whistle

former spin doctor springs from the deterioration in media relations on the last lions tour of australia in when new zealander graham henry was the head coach the furore surrounding the newspaper

open because of her persistent wrist injury open chief paul mcnamee had said kim wrist obviously isn going to be rehabilitated but her spokesman insisted she had simply delayed submitting her entry the doctors are assessing her injury on weekly basis and if there is no risk she could play but if there the least risk she will stay away despite being absent from the wta entry list for the tournament which begins on january clijsters would be certain to get wild card if she requested one clijsters is still ranked nd in the world despite only playing handful of matches last season the belgian had an operation on her left wrist early in the season but injured it again on her return to the tour meanwhile jelena dokic who used to compete for australia has opted out of the first grand slam of the season dokic has not played in the australian open since when she lost in the first round but the year old would have had to rely on wild card next season because her ranking has tumbled to th four time champion monica seles who has not played since last year french open is another absentee because of an injured left foot republic to face china and italy the republic of ireland have arranged friendlies against china and italy which will take place at lansdowne road in march and august brian kerr side will face the th ranked chinese on march just three days after the world cup

previous encounter back in june with the irish winning in sapporo japan brian kerr said china have made great progress over the last few years and will provide difficult opposition we all witnessed the performances of the asian teams in the last world cup and china play similar type of football as for italy they make welcome return to dublin and will be massive attraction because they are one of

operative balco president victor conte conte faces federal trial next year on charges of distributing steroids and tax evasion and white said at first he tried to cover up what he was doing he the one who told me that it wasn what he said it was white said in the san francisco chronicle but she added it was my decision to go to him not anybody else white said conte at first told her the substance was flaxseed oil only to change his story later white failed drugs test after winning the and titles at the world athletics championships she was subsequently handed two year ban in may this year and has admitted taking the stimulant modafinil at first white claimed she took the drug to combat narcolepsy but she now takes full responsibility for her actions my whole belief about victor is that he was selling product white said in the la times whether it be good product or bad product he was selling product white was introduced to conte through her coach remy korchemy who is also defendant in the balco case the year old believes doping is so common in sport she felt compelled to cheat herself if she was to have any chance of winning have no clue what it going to take to change that said

kuznetsova doping row says he will not apologise for making allegations against her claude eerdekens claims the us open champion tested positive for ephedrine at an exhibition event last month criticised for making the announcement he said will never apologise this product is banned and it up to her to explain why it there kuznetsova says the stimulant may have been in cold remedy she took the russian said she did nothing wrong by taking the medicine during the event the women tennis association cleared kuznetsova of any offence because the drug is not banned when taken out of competition eerdekens said he made the statement in order to protect the other three players that took part in the tournament belgian justine henin hardenne nathalie dechy of france and russia elena dementieva but dechy is fuming that she has been implicated in the row how can you be happy when you see your face on the cover page and talking about doping dechy said really upset about it and think the belgian government did really bad job about this think we deserve an apology from the guy you cannot say anything like this you cannot say some stuff like this saying it one of these girls this is terrible dementieva is also angry and says that dechy and herself are the real victims of the scandal you have no idea what have been through all these days it been too hard on me she said the wta are trying to handle this problem by saying there are three victims but see only two victims in this story me and nathalie dechy who really have nothing to do with this to be honest with you don feel like want to talk to sveta at all just very upset with the way everything has happened poll explains free kick decision referee graham poll said he applied the laws of the game in allowing arsenal striker thierry henry free kick in sunday draw with chelsea keeper petr cech was organising his defensive wall when henry quick free kick flew in which angered chelsea the whistle doesn need to be blown asked henry do you want wall he said can take it please he was very polite said yes said poll deal with the laws of the game deal with fact poll added gave the signal for him to take it that what he did the same thing happened when refereed chelsea against west ham in an fa cup replay two years ago when jimmy floyd hasselbaink scored and don remember them complaining about that henry explained why he paused before striking the ball for the goal which put arsenal ahead henry told bbc radio five live the ref asked me if wanted yards or if wanted to take it straight away and said that wanted to take it straight away he said to me go it looks bit strange because took my time was waiting for eidur gudjohnsen to move and give me some space at one point he turned and that when tried it former referees chief philip don backed poll decision to allow the strike the advantage should go to the non offending team on this occasion it was arsenal don told bbc radio five live referees have been told to ask the player do you want to take the quick free kick or do you want me to get the wall back metres if they say quick the referee tends to move away and allow the kick don was head of the referees for the premier league and revealed all clubs were informed of free kick options we spoke to all the premier league clubs as well as all the football league clubs in the summer of explaining what the situation was he added we gave them the option of either the quick free kick or the ceremonial free kick players and clubs were aware of what referees were doing italy wales wales secured their first away win in the rbs six nations for nearly four years with six try victory in rome tries from jonathan thomas tom shanklin and martyn williams gave the visitors half time advantage luciano orquera did reply with one for italy but second half efforts from brent cockbain shane williams and robert sidoli sealed victory fly half stephen jones added four conversions as wales maintained their superb start to this year tournament starting full of confidence after their victory over england the visitors scored the opening try after just four minutes diminutive wing shane williams fielded kick ahead and danced past the onrushing andrea masi and aaron persico into the italian half his pass to tom shanklin appeared forward but when the centre was held up short the ball was switched left and michael owen long cut out pass gave the lurking thomas an easy run in stephen jones who retained the kicking duties despite gavin henson heroics against england slotted an excellent conversion from wide out wales twice threatened further scores but failed to find the crucial pass and italy hit back out of the blue in the th minute henson sporting gold boots rather than the silver variety that did for england beat two players with ease out on the left touchline but his attempted chip ahead was charged down by orquera who snaffled the loose ball and hared away from halfway to score in the right corner with the welsh line out stuttering and italy twice turning the visitors scrum the home side forward power brought them back into it but clever high kick from henson almost brought try for hal luscombe when roland de marigny and ludovico nitoglia made hash of claiming it as the ball bounced into touch wales regained control with second try in the st minute henson lobbing up high kick to the left corner where shanklin jumped higher than nitoglia to dot down his th test try jones was unable to convert and de marigny then hit the upright with penalty attempt for italy henson was also narrowly short with long range effort at goal but wales ended the half with vital third score to give themselves some breathing space henson sent luscombe streaking away and when he off loaded to martyn williams the flanker showed his nous to ground the ball against the padding of the post jones adding the conversion italy who lost flanker mauro bergamasco with head knock before half time built up head of steam on the resumption de marigny landed penalty to make it and nitoglia break through the middle threatened try only for the move to break down with knock on but wales put the outcome beyond doubt with two superb tries in four minutes before the hour their fourth after minutes was sparked by another mazy run from shane williams who beat several players with ease and finished with powerful angled run from lock cockbain before italy could recover from that blow strong surge from gareth thomas and great off loads from martyn williams and replacement kevin morgan saw shane williams scamper over with jones converting both for lead wales had the luxury of sending on five more replacements for the final quarter the icing on the cake came with sixth try after more superb support work shane williams and ceri sweeney combining to send sidoli over in the left corner the only downside for wales was hamstring injury suffered by luscombe but after back to back wins at the start of the tournament for the first time in years they will travel to paris in fortnight looking like genuine contenders de marigny mirco bergamasco pozzebon masi nitoglia orquera troncon lo

hewitt came through dramatic five set battle with argentine david nalbandian to reach the australian open semi finals hewitt looked to be cruising to victory after racing into two set lead but nalbandian broke his serve three times in both of the next two sets to set up nailbiting decider hewitt eventually grabbed the vital break in the th game and served out to win and set up meeting with andy roddick the winner of that match will face either roger federer or marat safin in the final ninth seed nalbandian had never come back from two sets down to win match and there was no indication he would do so as hewitt dominated the first two sets the argentine had stoked up the temperature ahead of the match by saying hewitt exuberant on court celebrations were not very good for the sport and he had words with hewitt during one change of ends in the second set when the australian appeared to brush shoulders with him as they went to their chairs the balance of power changed completely in the third set as hewitt allowed his level to dip and he double faulted twice as nalbandian broke on the way to taking the fourth set but the tiring third seed showed incredible reserves of strength to force the break despite being outplayed for much of the final set and three times coming within two points of defeat he then produced love service game to finish off the match in four hours and five minutes just kept hanging in there it was always tough serving second in the fifth set said hewitt who had never reached the last four at his home grand slam told myself to give everything and in the end it paid off once again it long way from holding that trophy up there but hanging in there only four guys left that can win and we re the top four in the world it set up for pretty good showdown in the semis and finals hearts of oak cotonsport hearts of oak set up an all ghanaian confederation cup final with win over cameroon cotonsport garoua in accra on sunday the win for hearts means they will play asante kotoko in the two leg final after the kumasi team qualified from group on saturday in the other group game cameroon beat of south africa in douala neither side could have qualified for the final hearts of oak started the game needing win to qualify for the final while cotonsport only needed to avoid defeat to go through louis agyemang scored the first two goals for hearts either side of half time before ben don bortey scored the third hearts looked set for comfortable win but cotonsport staged late fight back scoring twice late on first of all boukar makaji scored in the th minute and then minutes into injury time at the end of the game andre nzame iii was on target but it was too little too late for the cameroonians and hearts held on to win the game and place in the final the first leg of the final will be played in accra on the weekend of november and the second leg two weeks later on the december in kumasi in the other group game cameroon sable batie took the lead in the th minute through kemadjou before santos equalised on the hour mark thanks to thokozani xaba bernard ngom put sable ahead just five minutes later and then ernest nfor settled the game on minutes ruben cloete scored the south african sides consolation with just three minutes left on the clock tv calls after carroll error spurs boss martin jol said his team were robbed at manchester united after pedro mendes shot clearly crossed the line but was not given the referee is already wearing an earpiece so why can we just stop the game and get the decision right said jol after the draw but at the end of the day it so obvious that pedro shot was over the line it incredible we feel robbed but it difficult for the linesman and referee to see it mendes shot from yards and united goalkeeper roy carroll spilled the ball into his own net before hooking it clear jol added we are not talking about the ball being couple of centimetres or an inch or two over the line it was metre inside the goal what really annoys me is that we are here in watching something on tv monitor within two seconds of the incident occurring and the referee isn told about it we didn play particularly well but am pleased even now with point although we should have had three mendes could not believe the goal was not given after seeing replay he said my reaction on the pitch was to celebrate it was very nice goal it was clearly over the line ve never seen one so over the line and not given in my career it really really over what can you do but laugh about it it nice goal and one to keep in my memory even though it didn count it not every game you score from the halfway line manchester united manager sir alex ferguson sympathised with tottenham and said the incident highlighted the need for video technology think it hammers home what lot of people have been asking for and that that technology should play part in the game ferguson told mutv what was against originally was the time factor in video replays but read an article the other day which suggested that if referee can make up his mind after seconds of watching video replay then the game should carry on thirty seconds is about the same amount of time it takes to organise free kick or take corner or goal kick so you wouldn be wasting lot of time think you could start off by using it for goal line decisions think that would be an opening into new area of football arsenal boss arsene wenger also used the incident to highlight the need for video technology when the whole world apart from the referee has seen there should be goal at old trafford that just reinforces what feel there should be video evidence said wenger it great example of where the referee could have asked to see replay and would have seen in five seconds that it was goal holmes urged to compete at worlds jolanda ceplak has urged britain kelly holmes to continue competing at the major championships double olympic gold medallist holmes has strongly hinted she will not run in this year worlds and is undecided about next month european indoors but world indoor record holder ceplak said there is never an easy race when she is in the field there is only excitement at what might happen it is good for the sport she always fetches the best out of everyone ceplak has been great rival of holmes during the briton career and the pair fell out when holmes questioned the manner of the slovenian runaway victory at the european championships but the controversy has since been forgotten with ceplak acting as pacemaker for holmes failed attempt on the british indoor record at the norwich union grand prix in birmingham in ceplak added like running against her you know the race is always going to be fast that is the sort of competition that like she is special to me she was like my idol from the beginning of my career meanwhile ceplak will be looking to follow up last saturday win in boston with fast time and victory in friday night of athletics in erfurt germany britain jason gardener had been expected to defend his title in erfurt but instead he will save himself for competition in leipzig on sunday gardener decision means scotland man ian mackie will carry british hopes in what looks sure to be tough preparation for next weekend norwich union european trials in sheffield kuznetsova failed drugs test us open champion svetlana kuznetsova has tested positive for banned drug according to belgian authorities belgian sports minister claude eerdekens said that the russian world number five tested positive for the stimulant ephedrine on december kuznetsova was playing in an exhibition event in charleroi at the time eerdekens said there is problem ephedrine was discovered she remains innocent until proved guilty she can ask for it to be tested again the situation remains unclear as the tournament was not commissioned by the world anti doping agency wada the international tennis federation itf or the women tennis accosiation wta the test was carried out by regional belgian authorities and kuznetsova has not yet been able to have sample tested speaking at the australian open on monday before eerdekens identified her kuznetsova said not worried not using anything to push myself have not been notified of any positive test and think it is unfair that it come out the way it did eerdekens said that confirmation of the findings was sent last friday to the player address in spain as well as to the belgian prosecutors office and the belgian and russian tennis federations he conceded kuznetsova might have taken medicine which contained the banned substance we have simply stated fact he said it is for the federation concerned to impose the disciplinary measures after procedure that respects the defence either the ephedrine was taken to improve her performance or it is because she took some medicine legitimately to cure an infection however kuznetsova naming was condemned by russian tennis chief shamil tarpishchev first of all this belgian sports minister has broken every ethical rule in the book by naming player without any proof of wrongdoing without any basic evidence tarpishchev said we all know the basic principle in doping cases if there is positive sample then they should notify the international tennis federation itf as well as the national federation within three days he said this is not the case here as of today we have not received any statement from the doping officials nor did the itf today called the itf headquarters and they told me they know nothing about it if wada the world anti doping agency was behind the testing then we would also have known something by now otherwise all these looks to me as pure fiction and fabrication of the facts pountney handed ban and fine northampton coach budge pountney has been fined and banned from match day coaching for six weeks for calling referee disgrace pountney was found guilty of bringing the game into disrepute at rugby football union disciplinary hearing in london on thursday night pountney criticised referee steve lander performance in northampton defeat by saracens on february the last two weeks of the six week ban are suspended pountney pleaded guilty to the offence before panel consisting of chairman robert horner nigel gillingham and jeff probyn the ban means former scotland international pountney cannot enter the playing enclosure technical areas or go near the touchline tunnel or players and officials areas on the day of game ireland win eclipses refereeing errors the international rugby board may have to step in to stop frustrated coaches and players from publicly haranguing referees when things go belly up it may have to go the whole way and have nfl style video cameras all over the field or slap the vociferous perpetrators over the knuckles what the irb does not want is football scenario where the verbal slanging matches often overshadow the game itself sunday explosive six nations clash at lansdowne road was good example as ireland took another step towards their first grand slam since the game was as exciting as it comes with much improved england side enraged at few decisions that did not go their way one can understand that frustration there was no doubt that ireland had the rub of the green in their victory but the reaction from the england camp may not have endeared them to the sport blazers referee jonathan kaplan was not perfect by any means and two decisions in particular made him the villain of the piece doubt whether kaplan would have been too pleased at the comments made after all he has no public recourse to criticism it was the same for simon mcdowell the touch judge who was heavily criticised by scotland coach matt williams after their defeat against france as far as england were concerned there were queries over mark cueto first half effort when he went over in the corner from charlie hodgson kick england coach andy robinson referred to similar case at ravenhill in january when ulster were playing gloucester in the heineken cup on that occasion david humphreys kicked to tommy bowe who touched down in the corner only for the try to be wiped out but you cannot have cameras at every conceivable angle to pick up such anomalies perhaps robinson was right to say the referee should have gone upstairs when josh lewsey was driven over the irish line near the end lewsey claims he touched it down and was in full control however one has to credit ireland flanker johnny connor for cleverly scooping the ball away and blocking any evidence of touchdown but in rugby everything tends to even out over the minutes the referee also missed england danny grewcock taking out ronan gara off the ball to allow martin corry sunday stroll to the line those were the stand out moments in classic game between the two old foes but there were many more and one should not take away from those brian driscoll winning try was as well conceived as they come while charlie hodgson brilliant kicking display was another highlight and ronan gara tremendous ability to control the game was also crucial component but the defining moments came with ireland under the cosh in the final minutes two outstanding pieces of defensive play denied england and allowed ireland to hold on the first was denis hickie brilliant double tackle in the right hand corner he gobbled up cueto from another hodgson cross field kick then regained his feet to stop lewsey from scoring certain try ireland second row colossus paul connell was equally superb england had turned ireland one way then the other and the defence cordon was slowly disintegrating england prop matt stevens ran in at full steam to suck in few more tacklers unfortunately he ran into connell who hit him hard very hard and then wrestled the ball away for crucial turnover that spoke volumes about ireland back foot display with defensive coach mike ford taking bow at the end to win game like that showed that ireland have moved forward it may be tries that win games but it is defence that wins championships athens memories soar above lows well it goodbye to another olympic year and as usual there were plenty of highs and lows in athens obviously there no getting away from the differing fortunes of kelly holmes and paula radcliffe but want to remind you of few more events that made another year to remember or forget for athletics one of my favourite olympic moments was kelly success in the winning that race was the key to her success because if she won that then the would be bit of formality kelly had been full of should shouldn thoughts about going for the double in athens thought why wouldn you do the it your best event it was such good fun to commentate on her and it was nice to be able to be part of her athens story the victory for the british men relay team was bit of surprise but great climax to the games think the four of them jason gardener darren campbell marlon devonish and mark lewis francis knew deep down that it was their best chance of medal the lads had run poorly in the individual sprints so maybe they did lift their game when they knew something was really at stake hicham el guerrouj olympic double is much bigger achievement than kelly on global scale he was the first man since for years to win both the and titles as soon as he had added the crown and had finished commentating jumped up ran down the stairs pushed everyone out the way and just gave him big hug he is one of the few african runners who has embraced the tradition of the mile and he loves to hear all the roger bannister stories hicham is someone enjoy having bit of time with even though my french and his english are not very good what happened to paula in athens this year is the obvious low on personal level and for the expectations of the nation as well there were set of circumstances around athens that conspired to produce very dramatic ending which think has been greatly misunderstood dropping out of the marathon was the right thing to do but starting in the five days later was not wise that was her heart and not her head reacting paula had lot of little things going wrong in her preparation and on the day things like niggling injuries not being able to do all her running sessions and feeling the pressure of the race looming ahead of her think she came to the start line in athens physically and emotionally drained and if even the smallest thing doesn feel right when you are preparing to race marathon miles down the road it will hit you like brick wall the positive thing to take from paula olympics it that she will have learned lot from it and so will lot of people including me purely as race paula victory in the new york marathon has to go down as one of the most thrilling it was so nip and tuck between her and kenya susan chepkemei and you don usually get that kind of excitement in marathons it was also real delight for all athletics fans because to use one of my favourite words paula showed real bouncebackability and it was bit of rarity for me too because genuinely did not have an inkling how the race was going to pan out kelly and the boys victories papered over the cracks in the general performance of the british team we should be concerned that we re not producing enough people who are capable of reaching finals at senior level the only individual men finalist on the track was michael east in the am beginning to look down and wonder where are the new breed and that where things begin to look even gloomier for british athletics as we did not win any medals at the world junior championships in italy dani barnes came fourth in the and she was the highest finisher for team gb the thing is if we don have athletes getting into the finals at junior level then it really doesn look good for the beijing olympics and beyond tell you what really enjoyed this year benita johnson winning the world cross country championships back in march in the absence of paula we tend to think of the event as something of an african preserve so to have an australian come up and deliver such surprise was something special to be honest getting bored with all the drug scandals especially balco just wish the whole thing would come to head so we can move on having said that always pleased when drugs cheats are caught because it shows the sport is standing up to it and not turning blind eye anymore and one of the positive things to come out of balco is people are starting to blow the whistle we need more people to come forward and help the authorities kick out the cheats as regards the case against greek sprinters kostas kenteris and katerina thanou well suspicions have been hanging over kenteris for while the bottom line is we cannot keep letting drugs damage the sport because if we do then it stops everyone enjoying it souness backs smith for scotland graeme souness believes walter smith would be the perfect choice to succeed berti vogts as scotland manager souness former assistant at rangers is hot favourite to take over from vogts who resigned on monday walter is most definitely the ideal candidate for that job he be perfect for it souness told bbc sport the scottish football association has appointed tommy burns as provisional caretaker boss for the

souness joined sir alex ferguson in backing smith claims the scottish football association is about to embark on the search for vogts successor after appointing tommy burns in caretaker capacity ferguson said he smith would be the outstanding candidate as far as concerned you need somebody who knows what they re doing and walter would bring wealth of experience to the job the man utd boss

rangers he would need to change the whole shape of scottish football and radical changes are needed smith was assistant to ferguson at the world cup in mexico in the former everton and rangers boss has been out of the game since spell as manchester united assistant last term bbc sport understands that smith would be willing to discuss taking over if he was approached by the scottish fa if he is tempted to take over it seems almost certain smith long time right hand man archie knox would also play part in the national team set up smith already has the backing of many pundits and fans including former scotland manager craig brown brown said walter is an outstanding candidate without doubt he would be admirable choice spoke to him on sunday and got the impression he would take it he was asking me about it and was positive other candidates for the job include former scotland midfielders gordon strachan and gary mcallister and vogts assistant tommy burns wales stars need rest ruddock wales coach mike ruddock has defended his decision not to release any of the international stars for this weekend regional celtic league fixtures ruddock says the players will benefit from the rest and their absence will give youngsters chance to impress we ve got the wru charter in place now which outlines exactly what happens ruddock told bbc wales sport once we re in the six nations the players will only be released in his and the wru best interests the ospreys and scarlets say they are happy to support the wales cause but the dragons have expressed disappointment at not being able to use their national squad players in friday game with ulster ceri sweeney gareth cooper ian gough and kevin morgan have been used sparingly by ruddock in the opening two six nations wins and captain jason forster believes they would benefit from game with the dragons sure the guys would want to come back to get some game time forster told bbc wales sport it would also be timely reminder to mike ruddock as to what they can do and the supporters want to see the star players no disrespect to the other guys performing on the pitch ruddock though is keen to protect his players from injury and fatigue at this stage there nothing more the players can do in games to impress me further we ve got to look at it at another angle and see the opportunities that are provided for the younger players in the region for example the dragons might use james ireland this weekend ve been looking at the lad he great prospect for the future french and english clubs have requested to have all their international players available which means stephen jones gareth thomas and mefin davies will play this weekend the majority of ireland and scotland players have also been released for provincial duty greek duo cleared in doping case sprinters kostas kenteris and katerina thanou have been cleared of doping offences by an independent tribunal the duo had been provisionally suspended by the iaaf for allegedly missing three drugs tests including one on the eve of the athens olympics but the greek athletics federation tribunal has overturned the bans decision which the iaaf can now contest at the court of arbitration for sport the pair former coach christos tzekos has been banned for four years kenteris and thanou had been charged with avoiding drug tests in tel aviv chicago and athens and failing to notify anti doping officials of their whereabouts before the olympics they withdrew from the olympics after missing drugs test at the olympic village on august the pair then spent four days in hospital claiming they had been injured in motorcycle crash it was the international olympic committee demand that the iaaf investigate the affair that led to the hearing of the greek tribunal the head of that tribunal kostas panagopoulos said it had not been proven that the athletes refused to take the test in athens the charge cannot be substantiated he said in no way was he kenteris informed to appear for doping test the same goes for thanou kenteris lawyer gregory ioannidis said the decision means mr kenteris has been exonerated of highly damaging and unfounded charges which have been extremely harmful for his career he has consistently maintained his innocence and this was substantiated by further evidence we were able to submit to the tribunal following its deliberations in january this evidence shows mr kenteris was never asked to submit to test by the international olympic committee so he could not possibly have been guilty of deliberately avoiding one it shows he has no case to answer mr kenteris should now be given the opportunity he deserves to rebuild his career in the full knowledge that there is no stain on his character he has suffered greatly throughout this ordeal that has exposed both himself and his family to enormous pressures but the iaaf said it was very surprised by the verdict spokesman nick davies said we note the decision of the greek authorities with interest our doping review board will now consider the english version of the decision philippoussis doubt over open bid mark philippoussis is almost certain to miss the australian open after suffering groin injury during the hopman cup loss to the netherlands the year old suffered two tears to the adductor muscle and was unable to play in the deciding mixed doubles he is now unlikely to be fit in time for the australian open which begins on january in melbourne he has to strengthen it enough to cope with repetitive days of tennis said hopman cup doctor hamish osborne it would be very unlikely in my opinion for him to do five setter once let alone two days in row inside two weeks the injury is more common in australian rules football and fit footballer would normally take three to four weeks to recover fully although mark injury is slightly different the australian has suffered host of injury problems throughout his career but is still holding out slim hope that he can make the event it something ll have to go by feel ll start treatment as soon as possible and try to strengthen it without tearing it any more he said what doesn kill you makes you stronger know can come back from this and that all that matters former world number two tommy haas is also doubt for the australian open after picking up thigh injury playing for germany in the hopman cup the year old had treatment on his left thigh while leading argentine guillermo coria he played one more game but his movement was hampered and he quit tindall aiming to earn lions spot bath and england centre mike tindall believes he can make this summer lions tour despite missing most of the season through injury the world cup winner has been out of action since december having damaged both his shoulder and his foot but tindall who recently signed for bath west country rivals gloucester told rugby special he would be fit in time for the tour to new zealand aiming to be fit by april and hope can play from then he said ve spoken to sir clive woodward and he understands the situation so just hope that can get on the tour the year old will face stiff competition for those centre places from brian driscoll gordon arcy and gavin henson and is aware that competition is intense but after missing out on the tour to australia with knee injury tindall says he will be happy just to have an opportunity to wear the red shirt quite laid back about it to be honest it quite hard for me to expect to be pushing for test spot he said but after what happened this season at least clive knows ll be fresh for

been granted extra time to decide whether to compete in the world cross country championships the year old is concerned the event which starts on march in france could upset her preparations for the london marathon on april there is no question that paula would be huge asset to the gb team said zara hyde peters of uk athletics but she is working out whether she can accommodate the worlds without too much compromise in her marathon training radcliffe must make decision by tuesday the deadline for team nominations british team member hayley yelling said the team would understand if radcliffe opted out of the event it would be fantastic to have paula in the team said the european cross country champion but you have to remember that athletics is basically an individual sport and anything achieved for the team is bonus she is not messing us around we all understand the problem radcliffe was world cross country champion in and but missed last year event because of injury in her absence

spending power the money is there don worry we ve got it edelman told bbc sport hopefully we ll spend it this summer and in the coming years arsene attends all our board meetings and he knows our finances are very strong edelman added that it was pointless having brand new stadium if the team did not match the surroundings its great to have nice new surroundings but if the team aren performing

cleared of missing drugs test by an independent greek tribunal thanou was provisionally suspended for missing test before the olympics but the decision was overturned the iaaf will decide if we can compete again in greece and abroad thanou told to vima newspaper in her first interview since the athens olympics if given the green light will run again that the only thing want thanou and her compatriot kostas kenteris were provisionally suspended by the iaaf in december for missing three drugs tests the third was alleged to have been on the eve of the opening ceremony of the athens olympics but an independent tribunal of the greek athletics federation overturned the provisional ban on march the iaaf which said it was very surprised by the decision of the greek tribunal is deciding whether to appeal against the decision at the court of arbitration for sport however dick pound the chairman of the world anti doping authority has said he will appeal against the decision if the iaaf does not and thanou and kenteris face criminal trial later this year for allegedly avoiding the test and then faking motorcycle accident thanou said can see how people can think the accident seemed like childish excuse cannot deny that we made lot of mistakes during that time always said we needed pr person an athlete would have to be very stupid to take illegal substances when he or she knows that they will undergo tests at any given moment am champion cannot risk everything ve achieved in such silly way roddick splits from coach gilbert andy roddick has ended an month association with coach brad gilbert which yielded the us open title and saw the american become world number one roddick released statement through the sfx sports group with the news but did not give reason for the split the decision to not re hire brad gilbert for the season is based on what think is best for my game at this time said roddick any more on this situation private matter between coach and player roddick won of his matches while working with gilbert and said he had enjoyed their time together he won his first grand slam event at flushing meadows last year and finished on top of the atp tour rankings but roddick slipped to second this year behind roger federer who became the first man since to win three majors in season federer who has not had coach since he split from peter lundgren

website he has been great student of the game during the time that we worked together and am very proud of the results that were achieved while believe that there is still great deal of work to be done andy clearly does not feel that way fa probes crowd trouble the fa is to take action after trouble marred wednesday carling cup tie between chelsea and west ham police in riot gear were confronted by section of the west ham support after the match which the blues won mateja kezman the scorer of chelsea goal needed treatment on head injury during the match after being hit by missile believed to be coin spokeswoman for chelsea said the club would await the referee report before deciding on its course of action kezman was forced off the field to receive treatment on cut above his eye but was able to continue chelsea assistant boss steve clarke said would rather talk about the football but we think it was something thrown from the crowd he did not require stitches west ham boss alan pardew said it shame because thought there was good english banter in the crowd there big rivalry between the two clubs and it is shame if that happened from where was standing didn see any trouble former hammers star joe cole also had plastic bottle thrown at him while frank lampard was pelted with coins as he was preparing to take penalty lampard spot kick was saved to the delight of the hammers fans who have still not forgiven him for leaving upton park the fa will seek reports from the clubs and the police and will review video evidence and the referee report police in riot gear battled with west ham fans in the matthew harding stand and at least one supporter required treatment fans are also thought to have clashed outside the ground after the game scotland yard said there had been arrests for alleged public order drugs and offensive weapon offences the fa is already looking into the trouble at tuesday heated carling cup tie between millwall and liverpool claxton hunting first major medal british hurdler sarah claxton is confident she can win her first major medal at next month european indoor championships in madrid the year old has already smashed the british record over hurdles twice this season setting new mark of seconds to win the aaas title am quite confident said claxton but take each race as it comes as long as keep up my training but not do too much think there is chance of medal claxton has won the national hurdles title for the past three years but has struggled to translate her domestic success to the international stage now the scotland born athlete owns the equal fifth fastest time in the world this year and at last week birmingham grand prix claxton left european medal favourite russian irina shevchenko trailing in sixth spot for the first time claxton has only been preparing for campaign over the hurdles which could explain her leap in form in previous seasons the year old also contested the long jump but since moving from colchester to london she has re focused her attentions claxton will see if her new training regime pays dividends at the european indoors which take place on march wales hails new superstar one game into his six nations career and gavin henson is already welsh legend mesmeric display against england topped off by his howitzer of match winning penalty has secured life membership of that particular club at henson has the rugby world at his silver booted feet and if his natural self assurance and swagger is shared by his wales team mates then full blown revival could be more than just lot of hot air drifting up from the valleys the red dragonhood subdued the red rose army in most areas of the field but henson stellar performance ensured their efforts yielded the win they craved above all others he announced himself in the game opening salvo with welcome to cardiff greeting for mark cueto on the gain line and his defence was major feature of the match his principal victim poor old or rather young mathew tait the england centre will have spent his th birthday on sunday shuddering at the memory of how he was up ended not just once but twice by henson all enveloping tackles the second time after the interval single handedly lifted the record millennium stadium crowd at time when england were starting to show menace showing awesome strength henson nonchantly held the bewildered debutant in mid air master predator toying with his helpless prey savouring the kill his kicking game also prospered particularly when he moved to full back for minutes either side of half time when his captain gareth thomas was in the sin bin one huge clearance from tait kick sent england retreating rapidly while another booming punt to the right corner kept the visitors pinned in their own half henson was also creativity personified one little chip ahead for shane williams narrowly missed its target precise cross kick forcing jamie noon to fumble the ball into touch he also had hand in the game only try finished superbly by williams and might have scored himself on the half hour as he glided into space only to be scragged by tait henson was twice repelled as wales laid siege to the english line after charlie hodgson penalty had edged the visitors in front for the first time but he was not to be denied as the crescendo rose to deafening din and the outcome of the match fell to him replacement gareth cooper made the most of poor welsh scrum by chipping into space where jason robinson was penalised for holding on in the tackle five metres in from the right touchline metres out it was not kick stephen jones who had seen long range effort fall agonisingly under the bar would have approached with confidence it was out of steve range but looked at gavin and he gave me reassuring nod said thomas henson surveying his date with destiny positively relished the responsibility and the chance to make himself hero without further ado he nervelessly slotted the kick that ended five years of english dominance and years of waiting in cardiff knew was going to get it before even took the kick he said later his distinct spikey locks freshly gelled into an appropriate star shape have been getting them from that distance all year so it wasn problem there were still four minutes for wales to hold out and the frenzy was such that henson could not even hear jones shouting instructions at him from three yards away but it was wales who finished the game on the attack almost snatching second try in thunderous climax just do it implored the front page headline on saturday western mail newspaper and thanks to henson wales did benitez joy as reds take control liverpool boss rafael benitez was satisfied after his team win over bayer leverkusen despite conceding goal in the last minute before the game if you had said the score will be would have happily accepted that said benitez but you must realise that you have to concentrate right to the very last seconds of game at this level have confidence that we can complete the task in germany am always confident and we must be positive benitez defended goalkeeper jerzy dudek whose failure to hold on to dimitar berbatov weak drive allowed franca to score with the last kick of the game and give the german team lifeline for the second leg for me it was not jerzy dudek fault added benitez he had played very good game and had we scored our other chances nobody would be talking about about their goal it would not have mattered if we had scored our other chances it would not have been worth remembering that last goal in my opinion jerzy played well made two very fine saves and am happy with him if we lose we are out but think we can score in germany certainly one and that will make all the difference and the liverpool boss is looking forward to having skipper steven gerrard who was suspended for the anfield leg back for the return in germany steven gerrard is key player for us said benitez when he is on the pitch he makes everyone else play better and the opposition pay special attention to him which gives space for others steven is one of the best players in the world but need team that is not about just one player there must be players on the pitch all doing well greek pair attend drugs hearing greek sprinters kostas kenteris and katerina thanou have appeared before an independent tribunal which will decide if their bans should stand they were given provisional suspensions by athletics ruling body the iaaf in december for failing to take drugs tests before the athens olympics the pair arrived with former coach christos tzekos to give evidence at the hellenic olympic committee offices decision is expected to be announced before the end of february whatever the ruling all parties will have the right to appeal to the court of arbitration for sport yiannis papadoyiannakis who was head of the greek olympic team at the athens games last year also testified at the tribunal along with other greek sports officials and athletes believe the tribunal will reach decision that will uphold the standing of the institution said papadoyiannakis whatever the athletes have done we must not forget that they have offered us great moments kenteris won gold at the sydney olympics while thanou won silver in the they withdrew from the athens games last august after missing drugs tests on the eve of the opening ceremony the pair spent four days in hospital claiming they had been injured in motorcycle crash the five member tribunal assembled by the hellenic association of amateur athletics is also examining allegations that kenteris and thanou avoided tests in tel aviv and chicago before the games tzekos was also banned for two years by the iaaf he faces charges of assisting in the use of prohibited substances and tampering with the doping inspection process all three who have repeatedly denied the allegations have also been charged by greek prosecutor and face trial for doping related charges trial date has not been set in imposing two year suspensions on the duo on december the iaaf described their explanations for missing the tests as unacceptable but kenteris lawyer gregory ioannidis told bbc sport earlier this week he was confident the sprinters would be cleared of the charges of failing to give information on their location and refusing to submit to testing we refute both charges as unsubstantiated and illogical he said there have been certain breaches in the correct application of the rules on behalf of the sporting authorities and their officials and these procedural breaches have also violated my client rights there is also evidence that proves the fact that my client has been persecuted vickery out of six nations england tight head prop phil vickery has been ruled out of the rest of the rbs six nations after breaking bone in his right forearm vickery was injured as his club side gloucester beat bath in the west country derby on saturday he could be joined on the sidelines by bath centre olly barkley who sat out the derby due to leg injury barkley will have scan on sunday and might miss england trip to six nations leaders ireland next weekend the news is just the latest blow for coach andy robinson who has seen his side lose their opening two matches in the six nations robinson is already without world cup winners jonny wilkinson will greenwood mike tindall richard hill and trevor woodman through injury vickery has broken the radius large bone in his forearm he only returned to the england side last weekend after long term back injury which was followed by fractured eye socket and the gloucester prop was only recalled after leicester tight head julian white suffered neck injury which has already seen him ruled out of the ireland game bath prop matt stevens is the only remaining tight head in england training squad and could be involved against ireland but he has to play second fiddle at club level to duncan bell who excelled for england against france and may now be called into the squad the extent of barkley injury is not yet clear but bath boss john connolly rates him no better than to face ireland barkley played at inside cente in england defeat by france and if he is unable to play england constantly changing midfield will once again have to be altered robinson could choose to recall mathew tait or henry paul although tait endured nightmare for newcastle against leicester on saturday and paul limped off with an ankle injury against bath in form leicester centre ollie smith is the other outstanding candidate and two tries against newcastle will have boosted his chances fly half andy goode is also strong contender for the

kieron dyer smashed home the winner to end bolton game unbeaten run lee bowyer put newcastle ahead when he fed stephen carr on the right flank then sprinted into the area to power home header from the resultant cross wanderers hit back through stelios giannakopoulos who ended fluid passing move with well struck volley but dyer had the last word in game of few chances pouncing on loose ball after alan shearer shot was blocked and firing into the top corner neither side lacked urgency in the early stages of the game with plenty of tackles flying in but opportunities in front of goal were harder to come by bolton keeper jussi jaaskelainen had to make two saves in quick succession midway through the first half keeping out shearer low shot and dyer close range header but that was the only goalmouth action of note and it was almost out of nothing that the magpies took the lead on minutes bowyer found space with neat turn on the half way line and striding forward picked out carr to his right he then continued his run and with perfect timing made his way into the box where he met carr cross with downward header into the far corner bolton had produced little going forward at this point but they responded well they were level within six minutes thanks to smart finish from giannakopoulos jay jay okocha twisted and turned on the edge of the area and after neat exchange of passes involving kevin davies and gary speed the greek striker found the bottom corner with first time strike the magpies were opened up again before half time as davies set giannakopoulos in space and given had to block at his near post but the home side survived and they should have re taken the lead with the first meaningful attack of the second half fernando hierro cynically chopped down dyer on the edge of the area with the midfielder clean through but the veteran defender escaped with booking as there were other defenders nearby and from the resultant free kick laurent robert curled the ball just wide bolton were creating little going forward and they seemed content to frustrate the magpies their strategy seemed to be working until the th minute alan shearer snap shot was charged down and dyer reacted first to smash the ball past the despairing jaaskelainen from six yards bolton boss sam allardyce am bitterly disappointed with the result but am probably more disappointed with the second half performance in the first half we had put them under lot of pressure and our goal matched theirs in quality thought it would lift us and that they might be tired after playing lot of games but unfortunately we were not up for the battle in the second half we allowed them to heap too much pressure on us and in the end we cracked newcastle boss graeme souness we deserved the win we had really good second half bolton are difficult side to play you have to match them physically first but we did that and then we played some football we had slow first minutes when we looked bit tired

sunday back under the spotlight of public scrutiny she will attempt to erase the double disappointment of the athens olympics where she failed to finish the marathon and then the bbc sport examines the challenges facing radcliffe ahead of the big race the ability to run gruelling miles relies largely upon an athlete belief that they can do it every runner will hit the wall at some stage and see written on it are you strong enough to finish the question could hit radcliffe hard after she was unable to complete her last two races in high profile and emotional circumstances sports psychologist hugh richards says the year old must draw on her past achievements to conquer potential crisis of confidence there is an old adage get straight back on the horse that threw you richards told bbc sport paula has got all those great runs in her history as well as the two upsets in athens she must not lose faith in what has already been proven is very effective strategy for distance running if she were to change her preparation and tactics that would be madness she wants to start rebuilding her confidence through performance accomplishment for much of the watching media and public there can only be two possible outcomes in new york win or lose if radcliffe crosses the line first she will have proved her critics wrong but if she fails to triumph she risks being labelled has been and her profile will suffer and for any athlete that can have repercussions in terms of sponsorship appearance fees as well as further self esteem issues athletes need to try and stay focused on their internal controls and ignore external questions explains richards who has worked with past olympians she must not get caught up in someone else agenda radcliffe best friend and fellow distance runner liz yelling revealed the year old is already aware she will be exposing herself to more public scrutiny in new york she just thought well they can think any worse of me now yelling told bbc sport she just doing what she wants to do and not thinking about the consequences of it radcliffe described her decision to enter the new york marathon as impulsive but she is certain to have tick list of personal goals her aims could be as simple as completing race and making sure she is still enjoying running but richards says she must avoid more emotional targets such as redemption you can change history warned richards only one person can win the marathon but lots of people can be successful paula has to figure out what sort of things will she feel satisfied achieving by the end of the race the course from staten island to central park is renowned as one of the toughest in the world it is also not the kind of fast course that tends to suit radcliffe better with the undulating finish through the park testing the legs final reserves radcliffe has never raced there before and will enter the unknown just days after the athens marathon it suggested after major marathon you take full month off and start building up again said yelling herself marathon runner but that is only for long term health and fitness when you finish marathon you are still very fit and can recover quickly so physically it is possible for paula richards also points out conditions in new york will be more conducive to strong physical display from radcliffe the heat stress was the primary factor that tripped her up in athens he said and that just isn going to be there in new york that been taken out of the equation radcliffe concedes she will probably learn lot from her bad experiences in athens in time and richards and yelling agree she could turn the trauma to her advantage starting in new york how you respond to adversity is what marks you out as elite or not argues richards one of the challenges of massive set backs is how you turn them into opportunities and yelling says think this will probably make paula think it will drive her on and she ll come out of it better athlete robertson out to retain euro lure hearts manager john robertson hopes place in the knock out stages of the uefa cup could help keep some of his out of contract players at the club it could help if we get through and have another european tie it may encourage players to stay at least until the end of the season he said if we manage to get through it shows how well the club progressing they have to think whether they are going to get other clubs like that should they decide to move on win for robertson side against ferencvaros would put them through to the last if basle fail to beat feyenoord it very much the player prerogative but the fact that we ve been playing european football for the last three or four years is obviously an incentive added robertson but we want players who want to play for the football club who are committed and run in europe always helps little bit with the game being played at murrayfield instead of tynecastle because of uefa regulations robertson sees both positive and negative aspects to the change of venue the pitch is not in the greatest condition the heineken cup game was there at the weekend and the pitch is bit threadbare he said it not ideal but it the same for both teams so we just have to go out and there and perform that the most important thing but he added if tynecastle could have hosted it would have been fantastic but that one of the benefits of murrayfield it allows us to bring even more of our supporters into it there will be good atmosphere and the hearts fans have an important role to play we need their encouragement we need them to get right behind the side and make it as good an atmosphere as possible hopefully the players will respond to that and know they will because it fantastic european night for the club jones happy with henson heroics wales fly half stephen jones admitted he was happy to hand gavin henson responsibility for taking the match winning kick against england jones had missed three earlier shots at goal when wales down were awarded long range penalty with four minutes left in cardiff knew the percentages of gavin reaching it were far higher than me jones said when he said he wanted it there were no problems jones had seen long range effort fall whisker under the crossbar on the hour before charlie hodgson put england in front with minutes left looked at where it was and knew was going to struggle to make it jones added said to gareth thomas the wales captain this is touch and go it was out of my range and obviously gavin is phenomenal when it comes to distance he was confident and fancied it there were no questions that he miss it the way he was playing he had superb game jones was happy to hail henson heroic contribution to wales first win over england in cardiff since physically he specimen he balanced player he glides when he runs and obviously he got great kicking game as well jones said his defence was superb he made some great hits and he had great game glad he welsh victory over england for the first time since will no doubt fuel expectations of what wales might achieve in this year six nations but they now face three away fixtures in italy france and scotland before completing their campaign against ireland in cardiff people all over the world want to see wales back at the top table of world rugby said proud coach mike ruddock but we are not there yet the next step is finding the consistency to get further wins we have to travel this week and we can afford to get too giddy about this result we have got to be professional and keep focused on facing italy none more so than henson who can now expect to have the same sort of spotlight thrust upon him as the likes of jonny wilkinson and brian driscoll the confident year old is undaunted by the prospect of dealing with such weighty expectations however the sort of player who likes pressure on me he said it makes me more concentrated and think perform better under more pressure set high standard against england and ve got to back it up next week two years ago when we played italy wasn involved and we lost so we ve got to put that right next week wolves appoint hoddle as manager glenn hoddle will be unveiled as the new wolves manager on tuesday the club have confirmed that the former england coach will be unveiled as the successor to dave jones at news conference at molineux at gmt hoddle has been linked with return to former club southampton but wolves have won the race for his services he has been out of the game since being sacked at spurs in september and worked alongside wolves caretaker boss stuart gray at southampton hoddle began his managerial career as player boss with swindon before moving on to chelsea and then taking up the england job his spell in charge of the national side came to an end after the world cup when he made controversial remarks about the disabled in newspaper interview the year old later returned to management with southampton where he again succeeded jones as he has now done at wolves he engineered an upturn in saints fortunes before being lured to white hart lane by tottenham the club where he made his name as player that relationship turned sour at the start of the last campaign and he left the london club early last season since then he has applied unsuccessfully for the post of france manager and had also been linked with return to southampton wolves are currently th in the championship and have home game against millwall on tuesday time to get tough on friendlies for an international manager friendly provides an important opportunity to work with your players the only problem is that the game itself can often be farce some people have been saying it would be better to get the players together for the week and do away with the minutes at the end would say it whether you should have these games or not and if you look at it that way you would probably say you re better not doing so it would certainly keep club managers happy as it would reduce the risk of players returning to domestic duty injured but international bosses will tell you that scrapping friendlies is counterproductive because the only way for team to get better is by playing the more you play together the easier it is when it comes to the crunch in games like world cup quarter finals against brazil often in friendlies though manager will play his strongest side for the first minutes and then send out an entirely different one in the second half and it very difficult for any player to come on as substitute in side with few changes let alone whole team worth the debate will rage on and not sure there is satisfactory solution one manager who has got it right this week is walter smith the new scotland manager has decided to have training camp instead of friendly for his first international week since replacing berti vogts it is the sort of move you would expect from walter who is canny manager the players have had such hard time recently that he is better off getting them together in relaxed atmosphere and trying to generate some team spirit before the next world cup qualifiers if he had sent them out on wednesday and they had been badly beaten it would have done them no good whatsoever john toshack has his first game in charge of wales and it will be important for him to get decent result against hungary he will have his own ideas on individuals and how to play and will probably look more at the performance but the public wants results it extremely difficult to get the balance for friendlies if you win people forget them but if you lose it becomes stat that can be used against you england game against holland is good example it looks like good opportunity to try out players like middlesbrough winger stewart downing or crystal palace striker andy johnson but you have got to remember sven goran eriksson side were given lesson by spain in the last game they played the injury problems in defence should at least give the likes of wes brown and jamie carragher chance to impress for the club managers it will simply be case of waiting at home with fingers crossed harinordoquy suffers france axe number eight imanol harinordoquy has been dropped from france squad for the six nations match with ireland in dublin on march harinordoquy was second half replacement in last saturday defeat to wales bourgoin lock pascal pape who has recovered from sprained ankle returns to the man squad wing cedric heymans and ludovic valbon come in for aurelien rougerie and jean philippe grandclaude rougerie hurt his chest against wales while grandclaude was second half replacement against both england and wales valbon capped in last june tests against the united states and canada was second half replacement in the win over scotland france coach bernard laporte said harinordoquy had been axed after poor display last weekend imanol has been dropped from the squad because the least can say is that he didn make thundering comeback against wales said laporte we know the ireland game will be fast and rough and we also want to be able to replace both locks during the game if needed and gregory lamboley can also come on at number seven or eight the grand slam is gone but we ll go to ireland to win it will be very exciting game because ireland have three wins under their belt have just defeated england and have their eyes set on grand slam france who lost to wales last week must defeat the irish to keep alive their hopes of retaining the six nations trophy ireland are

hoadley returned to haunt his old club at the madejski stadium scoring the opening try in the rd minute tom voyce powered through the irish defence for wasps second try before richard birkett went over unchallenged mark van gisbergen added points irish replied with three penalties and mark mapletoft drop goal before scott staniforth ran in consolation try barry everitt who replaced mapletoft late in the game added the conversion to become the fourth premiership player to reach points he joins jonny wilkinson tim stimpson and paul grayson in achieving that target wasps piled on the pressure in an attempt to grab fourth try which would have secured them bonus point but they were denied by some desperate defending from irish director of rugby warren gatland revealed that harsh words at half time inspired his wasps side to raise their game after the restart they got roasting and it was good second half performance when they came out and played to instructions he said gatland also singled out stand in flankers tom rees and john hart for special praise they did very well the back row played some fantastic rugby he added london irish coach gary gold felt the result exposed his side lack of consistency irish trailed by just two points at the break and gold said for minutes we lived with the best but we have got to get back for the full minutes gold will now turn his

ronan mccormack along with connacht bernard jackman and munster shaun payne gordon arcy is back after injury while munster flanker alan quinlan also returns to international consideration the squad is selected purely on form lot of players put their hands up coach eddie sullivan told bbc sport kieran campbell was just one of those players he has been playing very well in the heineken cup and deserves his call up there is big competition in some departments and not so much in others there were one or two players who were unfortunate just to miss out back row forwards david wallace and victor costello are omitted with sullivan having quinlan wilson simon easterby anthony foley denis leamy and johnny connor vying for the three positions with david humphreys kevin maggs simon best and tommy bowe again included it is ulster biggest representation in training panel for quite some time munster and leinster have and players in the squad respectively while jackman is the sole connacht representative four british based players are also included ulster forward ronan mccormack said he was totally shocked to be included really looking forward to it said mccormack played with guys like

maintained their six nations grand slam ambitions with an impressive victory over scotland at murrayfield hugo southwell try gave the scots an early lead but scores from locks malcolm kelly and paul connell put the visitors in command by half time third try from wing denis hickie and third penalty from ronan gara who kicked points extended the lead jon petrie scored second try for scotland but late scores from john hayes and gavin duffy sealed victory after two hard earned away victories eddie sullivan side can now look forward to welcoming england to lansdowne road in fortnight scotland will try to give their coach matt williams first six nations victory when italy come to edinburgh but they again struggled to turn pressure into points the home side started with tremendous intensity and dominated territory and possession in the opening minutes powerful charge from flanker jason white was carried on by ali hogg and when ireland conceded penalty close to their own line scotland kicked it to touch the irish defence foiled the home side on that occasion but stray hand in ruck allowed paterson to stroke over penalty in the eighth minute if that was paltry reward for their early pressure scotland got the try they deserved when paterson searing break and andy craig pass sent southwell streaking to the right corner paterson was off target with the conversion and fly half dan parks then missed presentable drop goal attempt ireland got themselves on the scoreboard with an gara penalty and by the th minute the visitors were ahead stuart grimes pulled down kelly at line out ireland kicked the penalty to touch and from the set piece the big lock was driven over by the rest of his pack gara added the conversion and further penalty after shane horgan almost grabbed second try from gara chip to the corner only for the ball to spill from his hand but ireland still delivered hammer blow to scotland hopes just before the interval connell skipper in the absence of brian driscoll powered through parks weak tackle after free kick from scrummage to burrow over scotland suffered further blow on the resumption when ireland flanker johnny connor won another vital turnover and gara basketball pass sent hickie over in the left corner gara converted and then thumped over penalty to give the visitors commanding advantage scotland looked bereft of ideas but half break from paterson sparked them back to life just before the hour stuart grimes won line out and well worked move saw petrie scuttle round the side of the ruck to dive over in the left corner but it proved false dawn and ireland reasserted their authority in the final minutes peter stringer and kelly combined to put giant prop hayes over in the right corner before replacement gavin duffy scorched away on the left david humphreys adding the final flourish with touchline conversion paterson danielli craig southwell lamont parks cusiter smith bulloch capt kerr grimes murray white hogg petrie russell

duffy joel jutge france officials respond in court row australian tennis top official has defended the australian open courts at melbourne park after criticism of the playing surface by lleyton hewitt hewitt said he had had gutful of trying to persuade them to make the surface faster but tennis australia geoff pollard rejected his comments we did ask for it to be made faster than last year and to my knowledge it is faster he said we spent substantial amount of money on modifications to make it faster hewitt who has not got past the fourth round at melbourne in seven attempts had earlier said the surface was not worthy of such prestigious tournament but he said he would play on whatever surface he had to in order to have chance of winning the tournament starts on january and pollard said the surface had been speeded up since last year tournament following complaints by several australian players but he refused to accept that the melbourne surface may have had bearing on hewitt performances over the years lleyton proving how versatile he is on all surfaces he said it is faster than last year and that ll be faster than the one lleyton beat roger federer on in the davis cup in anelka apologises for criticism manchester city striker nicolas anelka has issued an apology for criticising the ambitions of the club anelka was quoted in french newspaper as saying he would like to play in the champions league for bigger club but chairman john wardle said ve spoken to nicolas and he apologised for anything that might have been mistakenly taken from the french press we are big club nicolas told me that he agrees with me that we are big club wardle was speaking at the club annual general meeting where he also confirmed the club had not received any bids for the former arsenal and real madrid striker the club still owe french club psg from the purchase of anelka in may he has been linked with move to barcelona and liverpool and reds skipper steven gerrard also revealed he is an admirer from his time on loan at anfield but wardle added there been no bids for nicolas anelka no one has come to me and said would like to buy nicolas anelka if bid comes in for nicolas anelka will speak to the board and then speak to kevin keegan if there was bid and it was bid of substance and worth taking then between us we decide we still owe some money on nicolas which we have clear out so it would have to be above that wardle did stress that the club was not inviting any offers for england winger shaun wright phillips he added ve no intention of selling shaun wright phillips if someone comes with silly bid ll have to discuss it but we re not putting him on the shelf to sell he is the heart and soul of this club and has his heart and sole in this club and he would be very upset if put him in the shop window he was an academy kid here he just signed new four year deal don think he do that unless he wanted to play for manchester city football club city recently announced debts of but wardle confirmed they would try and find funds to bring in players in the january transfer window he said like kevin like to see some players come in we ve got to see what we can do whether it on bosman or not we will try to be creative to generate some funds but maybe we have to start looking at clubs like everton and bolton to see how they have been dealing in the transfer market and do similar type of thing moya emotional after davis cup win carlos moya described spain davis cup victory as the highlight of his career after he beat andy roddick to end the usa challenge in seville moya made up for missing spain victory through injury by beating roddick to give the hosts an unassailable lead have woken up so many nights dreaming of this day said moya all my energy has been focused on today what have lived today do not think will live again spain only other davis cup title came two years ago in valencia when they beat australia and moya nicknamed charly admitted the davis cup is my dream and was bit nervous at the outset some people have said that am obsessed but think that it is better this way it helps me reach my goals if am obsessed it really incredible to get the winning point is really something spanish captain jordi arrese said charly played great game it was his opportunity and he hasn let us down he had lost three times to roddick and this was his day to beat him he had been waiting years to be in this position spain victory was also remarkable for the performance of rafael nadal who beat roddick in the opening singles aged years and days the mallorcan became the youngest player to win the davis cup what great way to finish the year said nadal afterwards us coach patrick mcenroe wants roddick and the rest of his team to play more tennis on clay and hone their skills on the surface think it will help these guys even on slow hard courts to learn how to mix things up little bit and to play little bit smarter and tactically better obviously it unrealistic to say that we re going to just start playing constantly on clay with the schedule but certainly think we can put the work in at the appropriate time and play couple more events and play against these guys who are the best on this stuff said mcenroe roddick was left frustrated after losing both his singles on the slow clay of seville olympic stadium it just tough because felt like was in it the whole time against one of the top three clay courters in the world said the american had my chances and just didn convert them the bottom line is they were just better than us this weekend they came out took care of business and they beat us it as simple as that weir poised for sunderland move larne teenage star robbie weir is poised to join sunderland after turning down move to stoke city the year old irish league midfielder was also being chased by rangers and fulham but mick mccarthy side appear to have won the race but larne boss jimmy mcgeough has yet to confirm that weir is on his way from inver park heard on sunday that he has joined sunderland but not from the lad himself he said robbie has an agreement with larne that he can negotiate with interested clubs personally would rather see him making an impact at local level to build up his physique before moving into the full time game he has been on trial with number of clubs but it would be great to see him making it at sunderland injury doubts beset wales squad wales have clutch of injury worries before wednesday international friendly against hungary in cardiff west ham gavin williams ankle looks certain to be out so uncapped wrexham defender stephen roberts is drafted in defenders danny gabbidon and gareth roberts plus ryan giggs have hamstring concerns while there are also doubts over robbie savage groin however manchester united winger giggs is expected to recover in time to earn his th cap at the millennium stadium there were also doubts over gabbidon fellow cardiff defender rhys weston but the full back appears to have shrugged off the knock he picked up in the bluebirds loss to west ham on sunday the news leaves wales boss john toshack short in defence

henri camara and nacho novo of rangers have both been suspended for offences missed by the referee in recent old firm game both were given automatic one match bans and additional disciplinary points for their actions that means novo will miss further two games because of his prior record camara will miss one additional game novo was found guilty of stamping on celtic stephen pearson camara was punished for kicking gregory vignal extremely disappointed don know if there lot to add to that said rangers manager alex mcleish of novo punishment but what will say is that at loss as to why that incident should be picked up and highlighted when there were so many other incidents during the game both players will miss this weekend games when celtic host dundee united and rangers visit kilmarnock unless they decide to appeal the additional bans come into effect from december meaning camara will also be unavailable for the home game against livingston while novo will miss the meetings with dundee united and dunfermline an sfa spokesman said they have seven days to appeal but with matches coming along at the weekend they would need to do so before friday but if they do appeal it won be heard before this weekend because it takes bit of time to seat up an appeals tribunal meanwhile bob malcolm and rangers have been informed by letter as to the outcome of the hearing regarding his reaction to rangers being awarded penalty in the same game malcolm substitute on the day was taken from the rangers dug out and spoken to by police about an alleged gesture he made but the sfa would not detail what if any punishment malcolm would receive once rangers receive our letter we will be in position to make comment on the findings added the spokesman melzer shocks agassi in san jose second seed andre agassi suffered comprehensive defeat by jurgen melzer in the quarter finals of the sap open agassi was often bamboozled by the austrian drop shots in san jose losing defending champion and top seed andy roddick rallied to beat sweden thomas enqvist but unseeded cyril saulnier beat the fourth seed vincent spadea and tommy haas overcame eighth seed max mirnyi melzer has now beaten agassi in two of their three meetings had good game plan and executed it perfectly he said it always tough to come out to play andre didn want him to play his game he makes you run like dog all over the court and agassi who was more than matched for power by his opponent two handed backhand said melzer was an example of several players on the tour willing to take their chances against him lot more guys are capable of it now said the american he played much better than me that what he did both times had opportunities to loosen myself up agassi added but didn convert on the big points henman hopes ended in dubai third seed tim henman slumped to straight sets defeat in his rain interrupted dubai open quarter final against ivan ljubicic the croatian eighth seed booked his place in the last four with victory over the british number one henman had looked on course to level the match after going up in the second set but his progress was halted as the rain intervened again ljubicic hit back after the break to seal fourth straight win over henman earlier in the day spanish fifth seed tommy robredo secured his semi final place when he beat nicolas kiefer of germany afterwards henman was left cursing the weather and the umpire after seven breaks for rain during the match it was incredibly frustrating henman said it raining and the umpire doesn take control he kept telling us to play till the end of the game but if it raining you come off the score irrelevant it couldn be more frustrating as was very happy with my form until now you don expect this in the desert souness delight at euro progress boss graeme souness felt newcastle were never really in danger of going out of the uefa cup against heerenveen an early own goal followed by an alan shearer strike earned them win and place in the uefa cup last obviously with winning in the first leg it gave us great advantage he said after the aggregate victory we got our goals early and in the minds of some players the job was done but then they got goal and perhaps made us bit nervous shearer goal moved him within of jackie milburn club scoring record of for the magpies but souness said he did not think beating the record would have any bearing on his decision to retire at the end of the season think if he got it this year he would want to stay next year anyway he added he struck the ball very well he always has done and think it was the power and pace that beat the goalkeeper souness also paid tribute to laurent robert who was at the heart of much of united attacking play in the first half he did really well and did everything you want from wide player more of the same in future please he said parry relishes anfield challenge bbc sport reflects on the future for liverpool after our exclusive interview with chief executive rick parry chief executive parry is the man at the helm as liverpool reach the most crucial point in their recent history parry has to deliver new seat stadium in stanley park by amid claims of costs spiralling above he is also searching for an investment package of size and stature that will restore liverpool to their place at european football top table but it is challenge that appears to sit easily with parry who has forged reputation as one of football most respected administrators since his days at the fledgling premier league liverpool have not won the championship since fact that causes deep discomfort inside anfield as they attempt to muscle in on the top three of chelsea manchester united and arsenal throw in the small matter of warding off every top club in world football as they eye captain steven gerrard and you can see parry is man with lot on his plate but in the comfort of conference room deep inside liverpool heartbeat the kop end parry spoke to us with brutal honesty about the crucial months ahead he only dodged one question when asked to reveal the name of the mystery investor currently courting liverpool polite smile deflected the inquiry but to his credit he met everything else head on in measured tones that underscore the belief that liverpool still mean business by business he means becoming title challengers again and locking the pieces together that will help return the trophy to liverpool is parry mission parry has already successfully put one of those planks in place in the form of new manager rafael benitez and his enthusiasm for the spaniard personality and methods is an indication of his clear feeling that he has struck gold benitez early work has given parry renewed optimism about the years ahead but it remains massive task at club with unique history and expectations this will not come as news to parry lifelong liverpool supporter but his quiet determination suggests he is no mood to be found wanting captain gerrard is central to liverpool plans and parry insistence that all offers will be refused is firm statement of intent as ever the player will have the final say and parry acknowledges that but he is determined to provide the framework and environment for liverpool and gerrard to flourish in terms of the search for new investment hawkpoint were appointed as advisors to flush out interest in march thailand prime minister thaksin shiniwatra came and went while the most serious statement of intent came from tycoon and lifelong fan steve morgan morgan had succession of bids rejected having come close in the summer only for talks to break down over potential costs for the new stadium bbc sport understands morgan is still ready and willing to invest in liverpool and parry has kept the door ajar despite currently seeking investment elsewhere morgan however has had no formal contact with liverpool or their advisors since last december blaming indecision at board level as he publicly withdrew his offer he was also convinced his interest was being used to lure in others so any new approach would now have to come from liverpool morgan will certainly not be making another call so speculation continues about the new benefactor with trails leading to the middle east and america but all met with an understandable veil of secrecy from anfield parry meanwhile sees the new ground as crucial to liverpool future but is refusing to become emotionally attached to the idea he is determined the ground will only be built on an affordable basis and will not make future liverpool management hostages to the new stadium parry will pull back the moment the figures do not stack up but there has been vital new development in north london that has re shaped liverpool thinking liverpool have publicly refused to entertain the idea of stadium sponsorship and potential naming rights but the realism of arsenal stunning deal for their new emirates stadium at ashburton has changed the landscape parry labelled the deal an eye opener and admits liverpool would be missing trick not to explore the possibilities he knows some traditionalist liverpool fans will reel at any attempt to call the new stadium anything other than just anfield but the maths of modern day football decree that multi millions for stadium and team could ease the pain would take if we had no investment but if we did keep him as for the stadium if it gets us cash what difference does it make really for gerrard don care who you are the directors would take the money and it is the way it should be we cannot let that sum of money go despite gerrard quality through cleverly worded statement the club has effectively forced gerrard to publicly make the decision for himself which think is the right thing to do critical time for liverpool with regards to gerrard ideally we would want to secure his future to the club for the long term am hoping he doesn walk out of the club like michael owen did for very little cash realistically would allow rafa to completely rebuild the squad however if we can afford to do this and keep gerrard we will be better for it would however be happy with gerrard transfer for any fee over parry statements are clever in that any future gerrard transfer cannot be construed as lack of ambition by the club to not try and keep their best players upping the ante is another smart move by parry would keep gerrard no amount of money could replace his obvious love of the club and determination to succeed the key is if gerrard comes out and says that he is happy clearly if he isn then we would be foolish not to sell the worrying thing is who would you buy or who would come pending possible non champions league football lions blow to world cup winners british and irish lions coach clive woodward says he is unlikely to select any players not involved in next year rbs six nations championship world cup winners lawrence dallaglio neil back and martin johnson had all been thought to be in the frame for next summer tour to new zealand don think you can ever say never said woodward but would have to have compulsive reason to pick any player who is not available to international rugby dallaglio back and johnson have all retired from international rugby over the last months but continue to star for their club sides but woodward added the key thing that want to stress is that intend to use the six nations and the players who are available to international rugby as the key benchmark my job along with all the other senior representatives is to make sure that we pick the strongest possible team if you are not playing international rugby then it still step up to test rugby it definitely disadvantage think it absolutely critical and with the history of the lions we have got to take players playing for the four countries woodward also revealed that the race for the captaincy was still wide open it is an open book he said there are some outstanding candidates from all four countries and following the all blacks impressive displays in europe in recent weeks including humiliation of france woodward believes the three test series in new zealand will provide the ultimate rugby challenge their performance in particular against france was simply awesome said the lions coach certain things have been suggested about the potency of their front five but they re very powerful unit with his customary thoroughness woodward revealed he had taken soundings from australia coach eddie jones and jake white of south africa following their tour matches in britain and ireland as result woodward stressed his lions group might not be dominated by players from england and ireland and held out hope for the struggling scots scotland recent results have not been that impressive but there have been some excellent individual performances eddie in particular told me how tough they had made it for australia and will take on board their opinions and scotland forward simon taylor looks certain to get the call provided he recovers from knee and tendon problems took lessons from in that they did make mistake in taking lawrence dallaglio when he wasn fit and went on the trip every player has to be looked at on their own merits and simon taylor is an outstanding player and have no doubts that if he gets back to full fitness he will be on the trip am told he should be back playing by march and he has plenty of time to prove his fitness for the lions and there are other players like richard hill in the same boat adriano chelsea link rejected adriano agent gilmar rinaldi has insisted that he has had no contact with chelsea over the striker chelsea were reported to have made inquiries about inter milan year old brazilian star rinaldi told bbc sport from rio de janeiro can assure you that chelsea have had no dealings whatsoever with either me or adriano parma and real madrid are interested but there nothing new there their interest has been known for some time adriano has scored goals in serie appearances this season and chelsea boss jose mourinho had claimed that he was in milan talking to adriano on the day he is alleged to have held clandestine meeting with arsenal defender ashley cole mourinho said he was just practising my portuguese with him because don need strikers rinaldi told bbc sport have to say that nobody from chelsea or any other london club has contacted me if they want to that fine can tell them what the situation is if chelsea are interested then they must make an offer inter are reported to have slapped price tag in the region of on the head of adriano who joined them just over year ago from parma real madrid view him as natural replacement for compatriot ronaldo but rinaldi said cannot give you price that inter would accept for adriano that something that would have to be negotiated between the interested clubs parry firm over gerrard listen to the full interview on sport on five and the bbc sport website from gmt but parry speaking exclusively to bbc sport also admits gerrard who has been constantly linked with chelsea will have the final say on his future he told bbc five live steven is above money he is the future of liverpool it doesn matter if it or we will not accept offers but we are also realistic enough to know we can keep steven against his will on the subject of liverpool finances parry also revealed the club is ready to explore the possibility of sponsorship deal for its proposed new stadium and responding to criticism from bbc sport pundit and former liverpool stalwart alan hansen he insisted talks on new investment are ongoing but added the door has not closed on shareholder and lifelong fan steve morgan parry joined liverpool as chief executive in july from similar role at the premier league there have been several highs and lows during his time in charge at anfield and he had busy summer overseeing the arrival of new manager rafael benitez and managing to hold on to steven gerrard on the subject of liverpool captain and prize asset parry revealed real madrid did ask for an option on the england midfield man during negotiations for striker fernando morientes he said they were looking for ways of saying they got more out of the deal for fernando morientes but the response to real madrid was the same steven is not for sale but when asked if gerrard would be liverpool player on the first day of next season parry said sincerely hope he will be steven knows my views he knows rafa views we have re affirmed recently to steven that we are trying to build team around him we crave success as much as he does we know he ambitious and nobody can argue with that think steven would dearly love to win things with liverpool more than he like to do anything else we all want to see progress by next season he not alone in that there are lot of other players who feel the same so we all have common aim it is expected chelsea will test liverpool with plus bid in the summer but parry claims he will be in no mood to listen there have been lot of open secrets about steven most of which have been complete myths it is suggested we had deal tied up last summer we didn had an offer last summer parry explained we had told chelsea that as far as we were concerned he was not for sale and we didn want to sell him in reality it didn go beyond that maybe there will be an offer in the summer maybe there won our position is we want steven to stay but we are also realistic enough and have enough respect for steven and he has enough respect for us to know that it is his decision that will be crucial you are not going to keep player like steven against his will that just doesn work but any idea we are going to accept offers for steven and then tell him by the way we ve decided to sell you is not on the agenda you can forget that parry is currently in the process of finalising funding for liverpool new stadium in stanley park which is set to open in and he confessed arsenal deal with emirates to sponsor their new ground complete with naming rights has given the anfield club serious food for thought he said have to say historically it is something have been against and have been on record as saying that but think the size of the arsenal deal is real eye opener would say in the past deals have been done frankly far too cheaply and it just hasn even been worth contemplating but the arsenal deal is the sort of deal that causes you to draw breath and say wow that interesting my personal point of view is that would find it hell of lot more palatable than shared stadium some liverpool fans would find such move highly controversial but parry countered recognise it would be an emotive issue for many supporters but you look at the amount of money available and it could go into the team if it was the right partner how strong an issue is it time will tell think the stadium will always be anfield not least because of where it is but do we need to investigate the possibilities of sponsorship think it would be remiss not to that not to say we have made decision that we will go down that road but think it is clearly something we have to explore on the subject of possible new investment parry revealed liverpool are still in negotiations with mystery investor with rumours of interest from the middle east that prompted the withdrawal of tycoon steve morgan who got frustrated by failed bids and what he claimed was indecision by the board he also accused liverpool of using him as stalking horse to attract other bids but parry explained steve has never been used as stalking horse there no need and that is not the way we do business we had discussions with steve over the course of think we came close to concluding deal in the summer but it didn happen quite genuinely the new interest did appear relatively late in the day just prior to the agm in december and as have said it was of such potential magnitude and that potential is so exciting we felt we had to evaluate it we are still evaluating it steve interest was taken very much on its own merits his enthusiasm for the club is there for all to see and who knows what the next few months will hold the door isn closed on anything we had perfectly sensible dialogue with steve last year we have common interest in making liverpool successful that dream we all share so as far as concerned the door is not closed would take if we had no investment but if we did keep him as for the stadium if it gets us cash what difference does it make really for gerrard don care who you are the directors would take the money and it is the way it should be we cannot let that sum of money go despite gerrard quality through cleverly worded statement the club has effectively forced gerrard to publicly make the decision for himself which think is the right thing to do critical time for liverpool with regards to gerrard ideally we would want to secure his future to the club for the long term am hoping he doesn walk out of the club like michael owen did for very little cash realistically would allow rafa to completely rebuild the squad however if we can afford to do this and keep gerrard we will be better for it would however be happy with gerrard transfer for any fee over parry statements are clever in that any future gerrard transfer cannot be construed as lack of ambition by the club to not try and keep their best players upping the ante is another smart move by parry would keep gerrard no amount of money could replace his obvious love of the club and determination to succeed the key is if gerrard comes out and says that he is happy clearly if he isn then we would be foolish not to sell the worrying thing is who would you buy or who would come pending possible non champions league football campese berates whingeing england former australian wing david campese has told england to stop whingeing in the wake of their defeat to ireland england coach andy robinson lambasted referee jonathan kaplan for costing them the game after disallowing tries from mark cueto and josh lewsey but campese told bbc sport robinson is living up to england reputation as whingeing poms stop going on about it as who really cares they re acting like they re the first team to be cheated of win england are contemplating complaint to the international rugby board after potential tries by cueto in the first half and lewsey late on were ruled out without recourse to the video referee but campese added scotland could have beaten france in the same way but do you see them whingeing basically things didn go england way and in typical fashion they make more of it when they believe they ve lost unfairly england are second bottom in the six nations table following defeats by wales france and ireland but although campese admitted he was surprised about their current predicament he insisted england were no longer world class england are beginning to realise that being world champions doesn mean you deserve to win every game he said they lost few key players and suddenly everyone realised the ones on the fringes were not all that good in the first place added to that the senior players aren standing up and they can do anything when the pressure mounts campese veteran of international caps said full back jason robinson would now be the sole englishman in his world xv robinson has been blamed for poor leadership in the tournament while his coach has been castigated for appointing full back captain agree that you can captain from full back said campese you need someone in the thick of the action and it very hard to give orders from all the way back there some people are leaders and some aren he not but there no one who stands out in england pack no clear cut leaders campese though defended coach andy robinson who he believes was the only choice after sir clive woodward resignation but he blamed lack of talent in the england camp for making the current coach look poor england face potential wooden spoon match against italy on march and the ex wallaby added if england lost that they be in bloody turmoil that said don think they will campese has tipped wales to win both the six nations and grand slam come the end of the tournament it been surprising tournament he said and maybe ireland have little bit more talent overall but playing at home is major boost and the possible grand slam decider at the millennium stadium will be just too much for the irish pearce keen on succeeding keegan joint assistant boss stuart pearce has admitted he would like to succeed kevin keegan as manager at manchester city keegan has decided to step down as city manager when his contract comes to an end in months you don have to be einstein to realise there will be manager job available at really good club pearce told bbc gmr will certainly be applying for it although whether the board deem me good enough to take it do not know pearce initially joined city as player under keegan in before becoming part of the coaching staff he was promoted to joint assistant manager following the departure of arthur cox last summer the former england defender had year as player boss with nottingham forest eight seasons ago but has made no secret of his desire to have another crack at the job he was linked with the manager job at oldham and keegan has stated he would not get in the way if pearce wanted to leave but it now appears pearce is keen to wait for his chance at city he added by that time will have been here for five years so at least they will have had good look at me and they are aware of my feelings with regard to being kevin successor obviously the issue is out of my hands but it is fantastic job for anybody just hope it will be me murray to make cup history andrew murray will become britain youngest ever davis cup player after it was confirmed he will play in the doubles against israel on saturday the year old will play alongside fellow debutant david sherwood against israel jonathan erlich and andy ram murray will eclipse the record set by roger becker back in greg rusedski takes tim henman place as first choice in the singles while alex bogdanovic will play in the second singles clash rusedski will take on former world number harel levy and bogdanovic who has previously played in two singles rubbers against australia will face noam okun murray is the brightest young hope in british tennis after winning the us open junior title last year and the bbc young sports personality of the year british number one tim henman who announced his davis cup retirement earlier this year believes britain can win the tie in tel aviv it going to be as really tough match israel have some really good players and their doubles pair of andy ram and jonathan erlich are among the top eight in the world but fancy our chances he said but henman urged bogdanovic who has had run ins with british tennis officials in the past to seize his chance alex is quality player he young but he got to keep pushing forward he got to be stronger he got lot of ability but he got to be more disciplined mentally and physically and if he does that he got good chance holmes feted with further honour double olympic champion kelly holmes has been voted european athletics eaa woman

dinner in october hingis to make unexpected return martina hingis makes her return to competitve tennis after two years out of the game at the volvo women open in pattaya thailand on tuesday she faces german marlene weingartner in the first round as competitor and athlete always want to win hope my body will hold up said hingis you miss being out there in grand slam final and not competing it big difference between playing and commenting for tv miss it lot the former world number one was when she retired after having surgery on both ankles and her last wta event was in filderstadt germany in october when she lost to elena dementieva only last year she insisted that comeback was unlikely but speaking in thaliand hingis admitted said that because didn know what would happen with my body her appearance will also benefit charities in the region and the swiss star will donate her prize money federer joins all time greats the last year has seen one player dominate men tennis and one country dominate the women game roger federer became the first man since mats wilander in to win three grand slams in one season and after anastasia myskina became the first russian woman to win grand slam at the french open two more followed at wimbledon and the us open meanwhile briton tim henman enjoyed his best year while greg rusedski fought back superbly from adversity federer began the year as world number one and holder of the wimbledon and masters cup titles and set about conquering new ground the swiss sounded warning of the dominance to come at the australian open he ripped through the draw before beating marat safin in the final andy roddick was the only player to put up any real resistance at wimbledon and federer performance against lleyton hewitt in the us open final was breathtaking federer again got the better of hewitt in the season ending masters cup his victory in houston proved to be his th successive win in final an open era record the only major let down was third round loss to gustavo kuerten at the french open and roland garros will be his main target in there was also surprise loss to the unheralded tomas berdych at the olympic games which saw chile dominate as nicoals massu took the singles and then paired up with fernando gonzaelz to win doubles gold another major trophy that looks beyond federer is the davis cup which was won by spain in home success over the usa in seville roddick struggled on the clay losing to rafael nadal on the opening day before going down to carlos moya in the all important fourth rubber henman broke new ground by reaching the semis on clay at the french open stunning effort and also at the us open quarter final defeat to mario ancic at wimbledon was disappointing for the limp manner of the briton defeat but he remains optimistic of going further next year british number two rusedski endured rollercoaster year returning to the circuit after being cleared of doping offence in march with his ranking down at many feared the year old career was over but he battled back in the second half of the season to re enter the top the russian women finally delivered on their long recognised promise in with myskina maria sharapova and svetlana kuznetsova winning grand slams before taking the season ending fed cup but while the young russians were on the way up it was different story for the belgians and the williams sisters only veteran lindsay davenport held the new wave at bay stunning run of form after wimbledon taking her to number one ahead of amelie mauresmo whose grand slam drought goes on the year started in regulation fashion as justine henin hardenne beat compatriot kim clijsters at the australian open virus ruined the rest of henin hardenne year although she was fit enough to win olympic gold but clijsters had an even more miserable she suffered serious wrist injury and then announced the end of her relationship with lleyton hewitt and will be happy to see the year end in their absence myskina thrashed elena dementieva in historic but woeful all russian final at the french open wimbledon was more refreshing affair as sharapova captivated sw showing nerves of steel as she battled past davenport and serena williams to take the title davenport was strong favourite for the us open but hampered by injury lost to the powerful and unflappable kuznetsova in the semis kuznetsova went on to give dementieva another grand slam final thrashing with the latter wayward serve becoming one of the talking points of the year with the russians still improving the likes of henin hardenne clijsters davenport mauresmo venus and serena will need to be fully fit and motivated in and it may take their compatriot safin to challenge federer on the men side lomu relishing return to action former all black star jonah lomu says he cannot wait to run out on the pitch for former england rugby union captain martin johnson testimonial on june the year old had kidney transplant in july but will play his first full match for three years leading southern hemisphere side at twickenham actually started training three weeks after my operation but was very limited until few months ago now it basically bring it on said the giant winger the match on june will be my first man game but have training schedule which is quite testing and combines with sevens and whole lot of things said lomu have got so much energy since my operation that train three times day six days week mohammed ali has always been my ideal coming back to rugby people said you are dreaming but it always starts off with dream it up to you whether you want to make it reality opinion has been divided on whether lomu should attempt to return to the game after such major operation but when lomu was asked whether he was taking risk he replied as much as someone going down the road being hit by bus there are lot of people in the world with one kidney who just don know it have talked this over had chat with the donor and this is to set my soul at peace and finish something started in when he made his all blacks debut at his lowest ebb lomu was so ill he could barely walk but he says he is now getting stronger every day and his long term target is to play for new zealand again the only person who saw me at my worst was my wife he added used to take two steps and fall over but now can run and it is all coming back and lot more quickly than ever thought it would to play for the all blacks would be the highest honour could get that is the long term goal and you have to start somewhere man utd stroll to cup win wayne rooney made winning return to everton as manchester united cruised into the fa cup quarter finals rooney received hostile reception but goals in each half from quinton fortune and cristiano ronaldo silenced the jeers at goodison park fortune headed home after minutes before ronaldo scored when nigel martyn parried paul scholes free kick marcus bent missed everton best chance when roy carroll who was later struck by missile saved at his feet rooney return was always going to be potential flashpoint and he was involved in an angry exchange with spectator even before kick off and rooney every touch was met with deafening chorus of jeers from the crowd that once idolised the year old everton started brightly and fortune needed to be alert to scramble away header from bent near the goal line but that was the cue for united to take complete control with supreme passing display on goodison park pitch that was cutting up fortune gave united the lead after minutes rising to meet ronaldo cross from eight yards after the portuguese youngster had been allowed too much time and space by the hapless gary naysmith united dominated without creating too many clear cut chances and they almost paid the price for not making the most of their domination two minutes before half time mikel arteta played superb ball into the area but bent played onside by gabriel heintze hesitated and carroll plunged at his fee to save united almost doubled their lead after minutes when ronaldo low drive from yards took deflection off tony hibbert but martyn dived to save brilliantly and martyn came to everton rescue three minutes later when rooney big moment almost arrived as he raced clean through but once again the veteran keeper was in outstanding form but there was nothing martyn could do when united doubled their lead after minutes as they doubled their advantage scholes free kick took deflection and martyn could only parry the ball out for ronaldo who reacted first to score easily everton problems worsened when james mcfadden limped off with an injury and there may be further trouble ahead for everton after goalkeeper carroll required treatment after he was struck on the head by missile thrown from behind the goal rooney desperate search for goal on his return to everton was halted again by martyn in injury time when he outpaced stubbs but once again martyn denied the england striker manchester united coach sir alex ferguson it was fantastic performance by us in fairness think everton have missed couple of players and got some young players out the boy ronaldo is fantastic player he persistent and never gives in don know how many fouls he had he gets up and wants the ball again he truly fabulous player everton martyn hibbert yobo stubbs naysmith osman carsley arteta

miller spector referee styles hampshire keegan hails comeback king fowler manchester city boss kevin keegan has praised striker robbie fowler for his landmark return to form the year old out of favour at city earlier this season took his premiership goal tally past with brace in monday win at norwich he is still quality player and knows where the net is we have just got to supply him with ammunition and in the end we did keegan said he has worked hard to get back to where he is now the former liverpool striker who moved to city in after poor stint at leeds has battled back into first team contention after struggling with fitness at the start of the season fowler overtook les ferdinand on tuesday evening to become the third highest scorer of all time in the premiership with goals and he only trails alan shearer and andy cole and keegan believes there is still more to come from the former england forward he can get better if we can supply him better added keegan people want to write him off but if he has kept the articles of those people who have written him off he could throw them back at them and they would be left with bit of egg on their face fowler double strike helped city come back from two goals down to clinch dramatic win at carrow road and keegan sympathised with norwich boss nigel worthington afterwards feel bit for nigel worthington he said his team have got great character they have lot of drive and enthusiasm know it is killer blow for norwich but really think they have brought something to the premiership the stadium and the atmosphere is great it is just tough league to stay in as they are finding out and as we know anelka eyes man city departure striker nicolas anelka reportedly wants to leave manchester city in search of champions league football anelka is in talks over contract extension beyond with city but is believed to fear his career will go stale if he stays at the club the news of the world reports that anelka told french magazine either decide to win titles or to have an easy life think will always choose football if great club makes me an offer he added to win titles you need players who have the capability of doing so if we stagnate between eighth and th place it impossible to progress if am going to score goals and not win there is risk it is going to create feeling of being fed up anelka has earned reputation for being difficult character to handle after spells at arsenal real madrid and paris st germain and he feels that is now coming back to haunt him am in talks to sign an extension to my contract he said am well here but the sporting aspect also comes into account playing for eighth place is good but miss the champions league won it with real madrid in and need to be playing in it and should be playing in it not in it because of things that have happened in the past and had nothing to do with football but don blame anyone it bit my fault italy ireland two moments of magic from brian driscoll guided ireland to workmanlike victory against italy pair of classic outside breaks from the ireland captain set up tries for geordan murphy and peter stringer italy led early in the second half but stringer try gave ireland lead they never lost the hosts cut the gap to with minutes left and nearly scored through ludovico nitoglia but denis hickie try ensured an irish victory italy came flying out of the blocks and took the lead through luciano orquera penalty after seven minutes it could have been better for the hosts but the fly half missed two kickable penalties and ireland drew level with ronan gara penalty midway through the first half the italians were driving at the heart of the irish defence and for the first quarter the irish pack struggled to secure any ball for their talented backs when they finally did just before the half hour mark driscoll promptly created sparkling try for murphy the ireland captain ran dummy scissors and made magical outside break before drawing the full back and putting the diving murphy in at the corner gara missed the twice taken conversion and the visitors found themselves trailing once again roland de marigny took over the kicking duties for italy from the hapless orquera and he landed penalty either side of the break to edge italy into lead the only ireland player offering real threat was driscoll and it was his break that set up the second try for the visitors shane horgan threw an overhead pass as he was about to be forced into touch and stringer scooted over with gara landing the tricky conversion penalty apiece saw ireland leading as the game entered the final quarter but they were lucky to survive when italy launched series of attacks winger nitoglia dropped the ball as he reached for the line and italy nearly rumbled over from driving maul an gara penalty put ireland more than converted try ahead and they made the game safe when hickie latched onto an inside pass from murphy and crossed for converted try driscoll limped off late on joining centre partner gordon arcy on the sidelines and the final word went to italy prop martin castrogiovanni powered over for try which was fitting reward

the only uncapped player in wales six nations squad gaining chance in the absence of ospreys loose head duncan jones john is young man with big future he has been playing with the blues for two years and has racked up mileage on his playing clock said ruddock he has international size is big physical lad and good ball carrier with high tackle count ruddock assessment was backed up by yapp coach at the blues former wales and lions prop dai young john been on an upward curve all season and is going from strength to strength young told bbc sport wales his ball carrying gives us good go forward he impresses in defence and his work rate is excellent he working hard on his scrummaging technique which he is keen to improve to become destroyer on the loose head to be fair to him he not quite there with the scrummaging yet but nobody can fault his effort commitment and attitude john very strong man and is eager for the challenge if he pitched in he won let anyone down he developing quickly but hope he isn pushed too quickly in way that would hurt his development ruddock hopes that the selection of yapp and dragons lock ian gough out of the international reckoning since falling out with former coach steve hansen will send message to other players in wales john and ian have been rewarded for impressing during the heineken cup competition said ruddock both of them have played well and we want to send message out that consistently playing well gets you in the squad we believe this is an exciting squad representing traditional values of welsh rugby and based on the performances in the november internationals we have strength and experience up front and well recognised talent pace and skill behind the management team just want to get hold of the players and get out on the training pitch at the moment they are all due in on sunday and that when the hard work starts wales make two changes for france wales coach mike ruddock has made two changes from the team that beat italy for saturday trip to france kevin morgan takes over from his injured newport gwent dragons colleague hal luscombe on the right wing and in the pack neath swansea ospreys forward ryan jones is preferred at blindside flanker to jonathan thomas thomas try scorer in rome drops down to the bench instead of ian gough while cardiff back rhys williams steps up in place of morgan luscombe is sidelined by hamstring problem sustained during the six nations game against italy last weekend however the experienced and in form morgan was already pushing hard for start at stade de france due to his impressive performances from the bench kevin was very much in the selection mix anyway and the unfortunate injury to hal gives him the chance to start said ruddock now that ryan jones has recovered from injury we have increased the options in the back row jonathan thomas is unlucky to lose his spot after performing well against italy and scoring try but such is the competition for places that every position is debated in detail for this particular game we felt we might not always be afforded the open spaces out wide we were able to exploit against italy so an extra big ball carrier in the back row is thought to be necessary on this occasion obviously it man game these days and there is every chance that jonathan will be making an impact from the bench wales have beaten france on two of their last three visits to paris and another victory this time around would keep them firmly on course for first five or six nations title triumph since graham henry former wales coach said couple of years ago that we should be bold when going to france and he was proved right said ruddock that is great way to approach the game and something we will further endorse with the players this week thomas toulouse capt morgan newport gwent shanklin cardiff henson neath swansea williams neath swansea jones clermont auvergne peel llanelli jenkins cardiff davies gloucester jones

players to have won we lost momentum last season but we cannot afford to to go another season without winning anything real finish as runners up in their champions league group means they cannot face

championship simon is one of scotland truly world class players so it is huge bonus said team mate chris paterson he brings whole new dimension to us especially in defence and his ability to slow the

to edinburgh with high hopes their coach john kirwan has warned his side they must eradicate the errors that blighted their loss to wales however or risk suffering third successive defeat if the defeat against wales has taught us anything it that at this level we can make any mistakes kirwan said in the six nations every error you make will come at high price we have to be aggressive for minutes keep calm in every situation and display great maturity on the pitch it will be fundamental to keep cool in the difficult moments in the key situations of the game kirwan has recalled the experienced cristian stoica at centre and drafted in david dal maso at open side after star flanker mauro bergamasco was ruled out for the rest of the tournament scotland have also made two changes

the moroccan who has not raced over cross country for years will not decide until two weeks before the event which starts on march if am to compete in it it is only if feel can win said the year old who is retiring in otherwise there is not much point in me going el guerrouj achieved lifetime ambition last august when he clinched his first olympic titles over and but the four time world champion

kenenisa bekele and world records el guerrouj could meet bekele in march as the ethiopian is the defending world cross country champion over both the long and short courses but the moroccan will not commit himself to the st galmier event until he assesses how well his winter training is going the return to training was very difficult because accepted lot of invitations these past few months said el guerrouj am almost month behind but am on the right track britain paula radcliffe has also not ruled out competing in the world cross country championships haven quite decided what events will

martin jol acclaimed his players for their patience in their fa cup fifth round victory over determined nottingham forest side we had the initiative but it wasn easy it was professional sort of performance the dutchman said forest played with lot of players behind the ball in the first half but at they were dead and buried looking ahead to the quarter final jol said newcastle have got very good side and they are always difficult however he added that his side who are four places above the magpies in the premiership were not afraid of anyone robbie keane skipper for the night and scorer of the crucial second goal echoed his manager sentiments on the last eight match they re on high but we re confident and in the last few games we ve played well and hopefully we can go there and get the win he said he conceded the win over forest which included goals from noe pamarot and mido was not pretty to watch it wasn the best display but it all about the result the irishman said we knew it was going to be difficult with the conditions the pitch wasn the best but we still tried to pass it we dug in and the gaffer said to us at half time to keep being patient and that the goal will come forest manager gary megson conceded his team did not deserve anything after poor performance if you play like we did and concede two goals from corners you re going to have an uphill battle against very good team he said if we defend in the championship like we did we ll not get another point we were organised but felt at times we thought the system would be enough but we didn look like scoring

dream tie we ve got our work cut out next tuesday but you can deny it exciting he said it would be sell out it will probably be on television we have financial problems and the revenue it could bring in would certainly help our situation we re happy to be in the draw but we ve still got to beat premiership team we ve got to beat southampton first and that going to be hard game but if we do there will be some celebration welcomed the opportunity to face united we re not counting on anything yet he said it is obviously going to be difficult replay judging by the way brentford came back at us on saturday and the fact that united have come out of the hat will give them even more incentive but ve been drawn against united so many times in cups and beaten them at both bournemouth and west ham there are no easy ties in the fa cup and sure nobody is counting on one newcastle tottenham or nottingham forest southampton or brentford manchester united bolton arsenal or sheffield united burnley

it was not yet done deal as well as the rugby football union the league the individual club and the england coaching team have say so it not quick decision he said he given us years service so if he wants to go we support him the prospect of farrell switching codes has been the main talking point of the super league season so far it came as bolt out of the blue to us admitted lindsay but he very loyal friend to the club so there no question that he deserting us he just fancies challenge although the move would be lucrative one for both farrell and wigan lindsay said money was not motivating factor for the club the money side of things hasn been concluded but it not the point for wigan he told radio five live shortage of money has never been problem for us even if we did have it under the salary cap we can spend penny of it anyway we rather have the player lindsay also said he understood why rugby union was so interested in signing up farrell it be great loss for us but great boost for

at tynecastle he was sent off for violent conduct in the th minute but we don know if he did something else after the whistle we don know how many red cards he was shown said an sfa statement hearts could also face action after three fans were arrested for throwing coins on the pitch rangers striker dad prso was also sent off during the same incident when he received second yellow card for wrestling the ball away from craig gordon and leaving the hearts keeper on the ground the sfa said once the referee report comes in then we ll immediately look at things we don normally get the reports until couple of days after the game but we re well aware of what happened here prso was sent off for two cautions and that will just be one match suspension the sfa is certain to come down hard on mikoliunas after southampton david prutton was banned for games on wednesday by the english fa for shoving referee alan wiley hearts boss john robertson said mikoliunas has thrown his chest against the assistant referee chest and got red card for it the officials have got to take into account the fact he young lad but people have got to take into account why he was incensed why were hearts fans incensed why did nobody from the rangers bench claim for penalty kick rangers boss alex mcleish accepted referee dallas had no option but to send prso off mcleish said glad to see the spirit of the players fighting to the very end literally with dado trying to get the ball back from craig gordon but it was over zealousness and don think hugh had any option edwards tips idowu for euro gold world outdoor triple jump record holder and bbc pundit jonathan edwards believes phillips idowu can take gold at the european indoor championships idowu landed at the british trials in sheffield last month to lead the world triple jump rankings it all down to him but if he jumps as well as he did in sheffield he could win the gold medal said edwards his ability is undoubted but all his best performances seem to happen in domestic meetings idowu made his breakthrough five years ago but so far has only commonwealth silver medal to his name edwards himself kept idowu off top spot at the manchester games but he believes the european indoors in madrid represent chance for the year old to prove his credentials as britain top triple jumper he has to start producing at international level and here is the beginning said edwards phillips still needs to be much more consistent sure victory in madrid will build up his confidence and self belief that he can be best in the world the qualifying round of the men triple jump in madrid takes place on friday with the final scheduled for saturday olympic champion christian olsson will not be taking part as he is out for the entire indoor season with an ankle injury davenport puts retirement on hold lindsay davenport has put any talk of retirement on hold after having largely injury free campaign the year old world number one had said that she would quit at the end of last year but after successful season she has had change of heart finally felt put myself in position to try and win grand slams again said davenport it would be tough to walk away when feel like can contend so there no point in hanging it up quite yet davenport has won three grand slams the australian open wimbledon in and the us open her career has been hit by series of injuries but last year she started hitting top form and won seven titles she was due to take part in this week hopman cup in perth but decided she wanted to rest

want to progress in and we are doing okay if we beat burnley we have home tie against another lower league club leicester burnley boss steve cotterill they will be fresh and we ll be tired that is an honest opinion but our lads just might be able to get themselves up for one more big game the atmosphere at the last game was very hot good verbal contest our fans will not need whipping up for this game just want them to help us as much as they can in positive way key match stats blackburn rovers against bolton is part two of an east lancashire hotpot that didn turn out to be that spicy when first staged on sunday lunchtime the weekend before last and resulted in scrappy goalless draw rovers who are aiming to win the cup for seventh time in their history and first time in years face another replay against championship opposition after eventually disposing of cardiff at ewood park in the third round but they ve not been beaten in the competition by club outside the premiership for nine years since ipswich then in the second tier defeated them after extra time in third round replay at ewood park on january history is on rovers side when they last met their near neighbours in the fa cup years ago it also required an ewood park replay which the home side won and when they last met in the league rovers did the double they first won their nationwide division one trip to turf moor four seasons ago and then thrashed the clarets on home soil manager mark hughes who won the cup four times as player is aiming to steer rovers into the quarter finals for the second time in years and first time since the season success here and victory home to leicester in the next round could see rovers in the semi finals without having played premiership opposition burnley make the eight mile journey to their fierce rivals determined to send blackburn the same way as liverpool in the third round but having failed to pull off another shock at turf moor it could be that the championship outfit places inferior on the league ladder have missed their best opportunity having said that burnley are yet to concede goal in this cup run steve cotterills clarets have been knocked out in the fifth round four times in the last seven years and have made only one appearance in the sixth round in years that was in the season before last when they disposed of premiership fulham at this fifth round stage while blackburn have not played since the fifth round tie burnley have had two league outings away from home drawing at derby and losing at preston that takes their winless run to four games the combatants from one time prosperous mill towns are both founder members of the football league head to head th prem winners six times th championship winners once november to remember last saturday one newspaper proclaimed that england were still the number one side in the world that statement was made to look little foolish by events later that afternoon at twickenham but it illustrated the wonderful unpredictability of test rugby at the highest level at the end of richly entertaining autumn series the final weekend threw the world pecking order into renewed confusion with australia triumph in london followed by france capitulation to new zealand clearly there is no number one side in the world at the moment declared wallabies coach eddie jones on arrival back in sydney there are four five or probably six sides all competing at the same level and on any given day the difference between one side and another is only about while that bodes well for rugby as whole it also sharpens the sense of excitement ahead of what could be the most open six nations championship for decade while the wallabies all blacks and springboks hit the beach before turning their attention to super matters in the new year europe finest have less than weeks before they return to the international fray and for the first time in more than decade it will not simply be straightforward choice between england and france for the six nations title that owes much to ireland continued progress and the belief that wales are on the verge of delivering major scalp to cement the promise of their autumn displays who secured first triple crown in years last season could go one better and win their first five six nations title since they start with away games against italy and scotland before england and france come to lansdowne road their momentous victory over the springboks can only bolster ireland self belief while ronan gara late drop goal to deliver victory over argentina was further proof that eddie sullivan side can now close out tight games not that england or france who have won nine of the last six nations titles between them will lay down quietly dismantling of the springboks suggested that even after the loss of such influential figures as martin johnson and lawrence dallaglio they still have the personnel to prosper the narrow defeat to australia was timely reminder that not everything is blooming in the red rose garden but the fresh shoots of post world cup recovery have been sown by new head coach andy robinson fresh desire to regain former heights is evident and if england emerge triumphant from an opening six nations engagement in cardiff fourth title in six years is within reach are in familiar revival territory but this time it appears there is substance behind the rediscovered style while south africa over confidence in cardiff made for closer scoreline than expected wales could legitimately claim to have had victory within their grasp against the all blacks in one of the best tests in recent memory if mike ruddock can coax reliable set piece platform from his pack there is no reason why victories should not ensue come february the last fortnight has left in state of bewilderment after an autumn series that began with superb victory over australia stunning defeat to argentina their first loss since the world cup could have been attributed to trademark french inconsistency but the manner of new zealand demolition job in paris has coach bernard laporte bemoaning lack of young talent coming through to replace the old guard fortunately for the french the opening match of the six nations sees them entertaining in paris after two reasonable performances against australia the scots humbling by the springboks forced coach matt williams to reassess his belief that win over one of the major nations was imminent while individuals such as chris cusiter and ali hogg enhanced their reputations lack of top class players will continue to undermine their best efforts who start with home games against ireland and wales before travelling to scotland are also hopeful of registering more than one victory for the first time in the championship as autumn gives way to winter and the heineken cup prepares to resume centre stage meantime the joy of six will keep the home fires burning until february rush future at chester uncertain ian rush future as chester manager is uncertain after he and assistant mark aizlewood refused severance package chester have won only two of their last league games but chairman steve vaughan claims he cannot afford to sack the year old liverpool legend vaughan said offered financial settlement so they could resign with dignity but an obvious action is to dismiss them haven because of the finances so technically they re still employees vaughan claimed that aizlewood had verbally agreed to the offer but the chester chairman added after they discussed the offer with their solicitor who also acts as their agent they decided to withdraw the verbal agreement which was disappointing rush was appointed at the end of august following the departure of former liverpool team mate mark wright who guided chester to the conference title last season chester were bottom of league two when rush took over but the former liverpool striker enjoyed an impressive start to managerial life taking the club into the third round of the fa cup and winning the manager of the month award for october chester downturn in form culminated in defeat at shrewsbury that leaves them hovering just above the league two relegation zone henman murray claim lta awards tim henman was named player of the year for by the lawn tennis association at wimbledon on monday the

robinson england coach andy robinson says english rugby has to act now to prevent injury destroying players careers he will be without host of big names for the six nations as the intensity of professional rugby union hits players injuries are part of the sport but we have to have look at the amount of injuries that occur in the english season robinson told bbc sport think players are probably going to have three or four years taken off their careers robinson will be missing an entire midfield for the six nations with the likes of jonny wilkinson mike tindall and will greenwood injured rugby union has become far more physically demanding since the game went professional nearly years ago as result three of the major stakeholders in english rugby have launched an injury audit to find out how players are coping the audit is jointly funded by the professional rugby players association the rugby football union and premier rugby as far as robinson is concerned its findings must not be ignored think there an injury audit coming out in march that got some great information in there that think everybody in the english game has got to look at he said if we don the situation is going to get worse and not better so think rugby as whole has got to look at this uefa approves fake grass uefa says it will allow european matches to be played on artificial pitches from the start of next season european football governing body made the decision at meeting of its executive committee on wednesday uefa explained that the move follows comprehensive studies into the sporting and medical aspects of using artificial playing surfaces they can be used subject to complying with uefa quality criteria but there use will not be made obligatory luton preston queens park rangers and other clubs used to have plastic pitches during the the but after two year study uefa insists the surfaces have moved on international matches can also be played on such pitches although games at major tournaments have to be contested on grass uefa spokesman rob faulkner said people in england have bad memories of the artificial pitches of luton and qpr in the but the latest generation are completely different and are much more like grass we have sanctioned its use from the start of next season but only as long as it is the latest generation of artificial turf and meets whole series of standards several leading clubs from scandinavia russia and eastern europe especially those who only play champions league or uefa cup matches in winter are now expected to instal artificial pitches mcclaren targets champions league middlesbrough boss steve mcclaren believes his side can clinch top four spot in the premiership and secure qualification for the champions league after their win over manchester city mcclaren said we are playing exciting football it magnificent result to keep us in the top five but how well we do depends how often we can get our best team out once we got the third goal it should have been four or five but we nearly paid for it in the end mcclaren also praised winger stewart downing and strikers jimmy floyd hasselbaink and mark viduka who both ended barren runs in front of goal he added if stewart keeps playing like this sven goran eriksson has got to pick him and the strikers scored great goals the combination play between them shows they want to play with each other and they are trying souness eyes summer move for owen newcastle boss graeme souness is lining up summer move for england and real madrid striker michael owen he sees owen as the ideal replacement for alan shearer who is due to retire in the summer although he hopes to persuade shearer to carry on michael is in the category of players who would excite the fans and we re monitoring him he told bbc newcastle he is great centre forward and only but don think we re the only ones monitoring the situation at real souness has also hinted he thinks shearer may carry on despite his stated intent to retire at the end of the season he believes the prospect of breaking jackie milburn club scoring record may influence the striker decision milburn scored league and cup goals between and while shearer currently has goals to his name without giving too much away am confident he will be here next season said souness can imagine him leaving without breaking jackie milburn scoring record souness also revealed he tried to bring back nolberto solano during the january transfer window the peruvian international was sold to aston villa year ago but in the phone in for bbc newcastle souness said tried to re sign him but villa were not interested in selling the former rangers and liverpool boss is also looking to bring in number of new acquisitions once the current campaign has been completed after three four or five new players in the summer we have got lots of targets he said don think we will wait to the last day of the season to say who are we going to target now henman overcomes rival rusedski tim henman saved match point before fighting back to defeat british rival greg rusedski at the dubai tennis championships on tuesday world number rusedski broke in the ninth game to take tight opening set rusedski had match point at in the second set tie break after henman double faulted but missed his chance and henman rallied to clinch the set the british number one then showed his superior strength to take the decider and earn his sixth win over rusedski serve was held by both players with few alarms until the seventh game of the final set when rusedski wild volley gave henman vital break furious rusedski slammed his racket onto the ground in disgust and was warned by the umpire henman seeded three then held his serve comfortably thanks to four serve and volley winners to take clear lead rusedski won his service game but henman took the first of his three match points with service winner to secure his place in the second round at dubai for the first time in three years it was the first match between the pair for three years henman last lost to rusedski six years ago and lasted two hours and minutes the pair are now likely to only face each other on court as rivals rather than as team mates after henman decided to retire from davis cup tennis leaving rusedski to lead the team out against israel on march henman who now faces russian igor andreev in the last admitted afterwards it was difficult coming up against his compatriot on fast surface you just take it point by point when you re fighting to stay in the match he said had to keep playing aggressively and competing to get chance now have to recover in time for the next match because the body doesn recover as quick as it used to especially after two hours and minutes lions blow to world cup stars british and irish lions coach clive woodward says he is unlikely to select any players not involved in next year rbs six nations championship world cup winners lawrence dallaglio neil back and martin johnson had all been thought to be in the frame for next summer tour to new zealand don think you can ever say never said woodward but would have to have compulsive reason to pick any player who is not available to international rugby dallaglio back and johnson have all retired from international rugby over the last months but continue to star for their club sides but woodward added the key thing that want to stress is that intend to use the six nations and the players who are available to international rugby as the key benchmark my job along with all the other senior representatives is to make sure that we pick the strongest possible team if you are not playing international rugby then it still step up to test rugby it definitely disadvantage think it absolutely critical and with the history of the lions we have got to take players playing for the four countries woodward also revealed that the race for the captaincy was still wide open it is an open book he said there are some outstanding candidates from all four countries and following the all blacks impressive displays in europe in recent weeks including humiliation of france woodward believes the three test series in new zealand will provide the ultimate rugby challenge their performance in particular against france was simply awesome said the lions coach certain things have been suggested about the potency of their front five but they re very powerful unit with his customary thoroughness woodward revealed he had taken soundings from australia coach eddie jones and jake white of south africa following their tour matches in britain and ireland as result woodward stressed his lions group might not be dominated by players from england and ireland and held out hope for the struggling scots scotland recent results have not been that impressive but there have been some excellent individual performances eddie in particular told me how tough they had made it for australia and will take on board their opinions and scotland forward simon taylor looks certain to get the call provided he recovers from knee and tendon problems took lessons from in that they did make mistake in taking lawrence dallaglio when he wasn fit and went on the trip every player has to be looked at on their own merits and simon taylor is an outstanding player and have no doubts that if he gets back to full fitness he will be on the trip am told he should be back playing by march and he has plenty of time to prove his fitness for the lions and there are other players like richard hill in the same boat running around the olympics it was back to official duties last week in my role as an ambassador to london olympic bid but still managed to do all my marathon training all the sporting people on the capital bid team think mad to be taking part in the london marathon the bid chairman lord coe admitted he would never dream of running marathon even though he was an olympic middle distance runner kelly holmes former hurdler alan pascoe and former sprinter frankie fredericks who is now an ioc member all wanted to know why anyone would want to run that far you have thought all these athletes who have been running for most of their lives wouldn think it would be that bad but the only person who was positive about my intentions was tanni grey thompson who has won the london marathon wheelchair race six times even though it was very busy week entertaining the international olympic committee ioc evaluation commission actually found my running schedule easier to follow when at home get distracted by all sorts of things but for the five days was in london was in pressurised situation but found it easy to relax by running on wednesday the presentations to the ioc team did not finish until the early evening so just managed to squeeze in minute run we had an early start on thursday because we had to visit all the olympic sites around london that was pretty shattering but when we got back to the hotel got back on the treadmill on friday evening went along to the special dinner at buckingham palace which was nice occasion never feel guilty about eating especially when exercising and because it was rest day didn have to feel bad about missing my training either anyway managed to do another quick run on saturday ahead of the final ioc presentations before heading home for my daughter birthday when was in london did all of my runs on the treadmill which isn the same as exercising outdoors one of the ioc technical staff from australia ran alongside me one day we talked about the sydney olympics and that made the time go past more quickly do find it quite comfortable running in the gym because there is more cushioning but when you re gearing up to running on the road you need your body to get used to that jarring feeling when your feet hit the pavement it was good to get out on the road for my long run on sunday after the week had was bit concerned wouldn be able to complete it but coped with it very well and even though it was bitterly cold put in and half miles only another to go then this year steve will donate all the proceeds from his london marathon efforts to victims of the tsunami steve will be writing regular column on the ups and downs of his marathon training for the bbc sport website he will be raising money through the steve redgrave trust which supports the association of children hospices the children with leukaemia charity and the trust own project which aims to provide inner city schools with rowing equipment
