once upon a time, a boy named jack got himself into the biggest, most humongous heap of trouble ever.
it all started when jackâ€™s mama asked him to milk the old cow.
but jack decided he was tired of milking cows.
â€œno way, no how.
iâ€™m not milking this brown cow now,â€ said jack, and he decided to sell the old cow, so heâ€™d never have to milk it again!
jack was on his way to market to sell the cow when he came across a peddler.
â€œhi, mr.
peddler,â€ said jack.
â€œwhere are you headed?â€ asked the peddler.
â€œiâ€™m going to sell my cow at the market,â€ jack answered.
â€œwhy sell your cow?â€ asked the peddler.
â€œtrade her for beans!â€ â€œbeans?â€ asked jack.
â€œnot just any kind of beans,â€ said the peddler, â€œmagic beans.â€ â€œwhat do they do?â€ asked jack.
â€œthey do magic!â€ said the peddler.
â€œmagic?
sold!â€ said jack, and he traded the cow for three magic beans.
jack got home and told his mama he had sold the cow so he wouldnâ€™t have to milk her anymore.
â€œoh dear, you did what?â€ jackâ€™s mama asked.
â€œi sold her for magic beans,â€ said jack.
â€œyou sold a cow for magic beans?â€ jackâ€™s mama couldnâ€™t believe what jack was telling her.
â€œthereâ€™s no such thing as magic beans,â€ she said as she threw the beans out the window.
â€œwell, i did make them disappear, but that still doesnâ€™t make them magic!â€ suddenly, the ground rumbled and began to shake.
a magic beanstalk grew up right before their eyes!
jack saw it and immediately began to climb the tall beanstalk.
â€œget back here this instant!â€ called jackâ€™s mama, but jack wasnâ€™t listening.
jack climbed up and up and up and up the beanstalk.
at the top of the beanstalk, jack found a giant castle.
he walked up to the giant door, cracked it open, and went inside.
inside the castle, jack saw the most amazing thing he had ever seen.
it was a goose.
but it wasnâ€™t just any old ordinary goose.
this goose laid eggs made of gold!
â€œthat is so cool,â€ thought jack.
â€œthink of all the things you could do with golden eggs!â€ and then, jack got the worst idea heâ€™d ever hadâ€”he was going to take the goose!
jack lifted the goose off of its perch.
just then, the biggest, most fearsome, and only giant jack had ever seen came into the room.
the giant saw that his goose wasnâ€™t in its usual spot!
â€œfee fi fo funch, if you took my goose, iâ€™ll eat you for lunch!â€ â€œoh no,â€ thought jack.
â€œthat giantâ€™s going to eat me!
iâ€™ve got to get out of here without him seeing me!â€ quietly and carefully, jack took the goose and made his way toward the door.
he was almost out of the room whenâ€”honk!
the goose cried out and the giant spotted jack!
â€œfee fi fo fummy, give that back or iâ€™ll call my mummy!â€ roared the giant.
â€œahhh!â€ screamed jack.
he ran toward the beanstalk.
jack ran as quickly as he could down the beanstalk, but the giant was following close behind.
just as jack put his feet back on the ground, the giant picked up jack in his enormous hands.
â€œfee fi fo fummy, i bet you taste yum yum yummy!â€ said the giant.
just as the giant was about to eat jack, the ground began to shake, and there, standing right behind the giant, was an even bigger, taller, more humongous lady giant!
â€œtwo giants!â€thought jack.
â€œtheyâ€™ll eat me now for sure!â€ â€œput that boy down, willifred,â€ the giant mama told her son.
the giant put jack back down on the ground.
â€œnow what have i told you?â€ she asked.
â€œdonâ€™t eat other kids,â€ said the giant sheepishly.
â€œthatâ€™s right, we donâ€™t eat other kids,â€ said the mama giant.
â€œbut he took my goose!â€ cried the giant.
just then, jackâ€™s mama came out of the farmhouse.
â€œwhat on earth is going on here?â€ she asked.
â€œwell,â€ jack began, â€œthere was this castle, and inside was the coolest goose everâ€”it lays golden eggs!
as i was taking it, this giant kid came in and was all â€˜fee fi fo fumâ€™ and then iâ€”â€ â€œyou mean you took this boyâ€™s goose?â€ jackâ€™s mama interrupted.
â€œyeah, but it lays golden eggs!â€ jack paused and thought about it.
â€œhuh.
now that you mention it, i guess that wasnâ€™t very nice,â€ said jack.
jack looked at the giant.
â€œiâ€™m sorry i took your goose.
i know i shouldnâ€™t take things that donâ€™t belong to me.â€ â€œthatâ€™s ok.
i suppose i shouldâ€™ve asked you to give me back the goose without trying to eat you.
iâ€™m sorry too,â€ said the giant.
â€œhey, do you want to play baseball?â€ jack and the giant became good friends, using the beanstalk to visit each other whenever they wanted.
â€œyou know,â€ jack said, â€œif it werenâ€™t for those three magic beans, i never would have learned how to play giant baseball.â€ â€œyouâ€™re right,â€ said the giant.
â€œiâ€™d say the whole adventure was a giant success!â€
